For unequal sample sizes, the F test has small probability of detecting many alternatives for which the t test performs poorly, and so the F test is not an effective preliminary test.

giant extrasolar planets around the 118 target stars from the Very Large

Masciadri and collaborators in 2003 and 2004), the VLT and MMT

Survey to set constraints on the population of giant extrasolar planets.
Our analysis is extended to include the planet luminosity models of
Fortney et al., as well as the correlation between stellar mass and
frequency of giant planets found by Johnson et al. Doubling the sample
size of FGKM stars strengthens our conclusions: a model for extrasolar
giant planets with power laws for mass and semimajor axis as given by
Cumming et al. cannot, with 95\% confidence, have planets beyond 65 AU,
compared to the value of 94 AU reported by Nielsen et al., using the
models of Baraffe et al. When the Johnson et al. correction for stellar
mass (which gives fewer Jupiter-mass companions to M stars with respect
to solar-type stars) is applied, however, this limit moves out to 82 AU.
For the relatively new Fortney et al. models, which predict fainter
planets across most of parameter space, these upper limits, with and
without a correction for stellar mass, are 182 and 234 AU, respectively.},

motion, no additional residual RV signal is present within our detection

either of the two stars. We performed numerical simulations to determine
the detection threshold of the CES survey for planets around both stars.

The determination is based on a sample of six planets detected from intensive follow-up observations of high-magnification ( A $>$200) microlensing events during 2005-2008. The sampled host stars have a typical mass M host 0.5 M $\Sun$ , and detection is sensitive to planets over a range of planet-star-projected separations ( s \textendash{}1 max R E , s max R E ), where R E 3.5 AU( M host / M $\Sun$ ) 1/2 is the Einstein radius and s max ( q /10 \textendash{}4.3 ) 1/3 . This corresponds to deprojected separations roughly three times the "snow line." We show that the observations of these events have the properties of a "controlled experiment," which is what permits measurement of absolute planet frequency. High-magnification events are rare, but the survey-plus-follow-up high-magnification channel is very efficient: half of all high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded planet detections. The extremely high sensitivity of high-mag events leads to a policy of monitoring them as intensively as possible, independent of whether they show evidence of planets. This is what allows us to construct an unbiased sample. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 8 larger than the one derived from Doppler studies at factor 25 smaller star-planet separations (i.e., periods 2-2000 days). However, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from Doppler studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is measured). This suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex in planet-star separation, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. Finally, if all planetary systems were "analogs" of the solar system, our sample would have yielded 18.2 planets (11.4 "Jupiters," 6.4 "Saturns," 0.3 "Uranuses," 0.2 "Neptunes") including 6.1 systems with two or more planet detections. This compares to six planets including one two-planet system in the actual sample, implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems.},

  abstract = {Aims: It is known that stellar spots may in some cases produce 
radial velocity (RV) signatures similar to those of exoplanets. To date, the most extensive set of data on spots, active regions, and activity in general for any star is that obtained for the Sun. To investigate the impact of these spots, we aim to study the detectability of Earth-mass
planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-type stars, if covered by
spots similar to sunspots. Methods: We used the sunspot
properties recorded over one solar cycle between 1993 and 2003 to infer the RV curve that a solar-type star seen edge-on would exhibit, if
covered by these spots. We also derive interesting parameters such as bisector velocity span (BVS) and photometric curves, commonly used in the analysis of RV data. We compare the obtained data with archival solar data available for the same epoch (e.g., irradiance, Ca index). We also simulate the RV of such a spotted star surrounded by an Earth-mass planet located in the HZ. Results: The RV of the spotted star appears to be very variable, in a complex way, depending on the activity
level, with amplitudes from a few tens cm/s up to 5 m/s (assuming DeltaTs = Tsun; Tspot = 550 K). A
correlation between the BVS and the RV data is observed even when
several spots are present with a slope so small that only data of very high precision (better than 5 cm/s) can enable its detection.
Photometric variations of up to 0.5\% are predicted, depending on the level of activity, in agreement with measured solar photometric
variations. Based on present assumptions, the detection of a 1
MEarth planet located between 0.8 and 1.2 AU requires intensive monitoring (weekly or more frequent), over several years. The
temporal sampling is more crucial than the data precision (assuming
precisions in the range [1-10] cm/s). Cooler spots may become a problem for these detections. We also anticipate that plages, not considered in this paper, could further complicate or even compromise such detections.},

Two main techniques are used to obtain precision Doppler measurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the gas cell method, which consists of least-squares matching of the spectrum of iodine imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second method relies on the construction of a stabilized spectrograph externally calibrated in wavelength. The most precise stabilized spectrometer in operation is the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), operated by the European Southern Observatory in La Silla Observatory, Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS are typically obtained using the cross-correlation function (CCF) technique. This technique consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum by a weighted binary mask and finding the minimum of the product as a function of the Doppler shift. It is known that CCF is suboptimal in exploiting the Doppler information in the stellar spectrum. Here we describe an algorithm to obtain precision radial velocity measurements using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. This algorithm is implemented in our software HARPS-TERRA (Template-Enhanced Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity measurements on a representative sample of stars observed by HARPS are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method. We show that, compared with CCF, template matching provides a significant improvement in accuracy, especially when applied to M dwarfs.},

indicators. In this paper we review the current observational material and discuss its impact on our knowledge of 'active' atmospheres, especially in the context of stellar rotation.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for analysing radial velocity data that combines two features: all the planets are searched at once and the algorithm is fast. This is achieved by utilizing compressed sensing techniques, which are modified to be compatible with the Gaussian process framework. The resulting tool can be used like a Lomb\textendash{}Scargle periodogram and has the same aspect but with much fewer peaks due to aliasing. The method is applied to five systems with published radial velocity data sets: HD 69830, HD 10180, 55 Cnc, GJ 876 and a simulated very active star. The results are fully compatible with previous analysis, though obtained more straightforwardly. We further show that 55 Cnc e and f could have been respectively detected and suspected in early measurements from the Lick Observatory and Hobby\textendash{}Eberly Telescope available in 2004, and that frequencies due to dynamical interactions in GJ 876 can be seen.},

The McDonald Observatory Planetary Search (MOPS) was started in 1987 September with the goal of detecting other nearby planetary systems. A stabilized I2 gas absorption cell placed in front of the entrance slit to the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m telescope coud{\'e} spectrograph serves as the velocity metric. With this I2 cell we can achieve radial velocity measurement precision better than 10 m s-1 in an individual measurement. At this level we can detect a Jupiter-like planet around a solar-type star, and have some hope of detecting Saturn-like planets in a long-term survey. The detectability of planets is ultimately limited by stellar pulsation modes and photospheric motions. Monthly MOPS observing runs allow us to obtain at least 5 independent observations per year of the 33 solar-type (F5-K7) stars on our observing list. We present representative results from the first five years of the survey.},

  abstract = {Kepler-78b is a transiting Earth-mass planet in an 8.5 h orbit discovered by the Kepler Space Mission. We performed an analysis of the published radial velocity measurements for Kepler-78 in order to derive a refined measurement for the planet mass. Kepler-78 is an active star and radial velocity variations due to activity were removed using a floating chunk offset (FCO) method where an orbital solution was made to the data by allowing the velocity offsets of individual nights to vary. We show that if we had no a priori knowledge of the transit period the FCO method, used as a periodogram, would still have detected Kepler-78b in the radial velocity data. It can thus be effective at finding unknown short-period signals in the presence of significant activity noise.Using the FCO method while keeping the ephemeris and orbital phase fixed to the photometric values and using only data from nights where 6-10 measurements were taken results in a K-amplitude of 1.34 $\pm$ 0.25 m s-1, a planet mass of 1.31 $\pm$ 0.24 M$\oplus$, and a planet density of rho = 4.5-2.0+2.2 g cm-3. Allowing the orbital phase to be a free parameter reproduces the transit phase to within the uncertainty. The
corresponding density implies that Kepler-78b may have a structure that is deficient in iron and is thus more like the Moon. Although the various approaches that were used to filter out the activity of
Kepler-78 produce consistent radial velocity amplitudes to within the errors, these are still too large to constrain the structure of this planet. The uncertainty in the mass for Kepler-78b is large enough to encompass models with structures ranging from Mercury-like (iron enriched) to Moon-like (iron deficient). A more accurate K-amplitude as well as a better determination of the planet radius are needed to distinguish between these models.},

  shorttitle = {Long-Lived, Long-Period Radial Velocity Variations in {{Aldebaran}}},
  abstract = {We investigate the nature of the long-period radial velocity variations in Alpha Tau first reported over 20 years ago. We analyzed precise stellar radial velocity measurements for Alpha Tau spanning over 30 years. An examination of the Halpha and Ca II 8662 spectral lines, and Hipparcos photometry was also done to help discern the nature of the long-period radial velocity variations. Our radial velocity data show that the long-period, low amplitude radial velocity variations are long-lived and coherent. Furthermore, Halpha equivalent width measurements and Hipparcos photometry show no significant variations with this period. Another investigation of this star established that there was no variability in the spectral line shapes with the radial velocity period. An orbital solution results in a period of P = 628.96 +/- 0.90 d, eccentricity, e = 0.10 +/- 0.05, and a radial velocity amplitude, K = 142.1 +/- 7.2 m/s. Evolutionary tracks yield a stellar mass of 1.13 +/- 0.11 M\_sun, which corresponds to a minimum companion mass of 6.47 +/- 0.53 M\_Jup with an orbital semi-major axis of a = 1.46 +/- 0.27 AU. After removing the orbital motion of the companion, an additional period of \textasciitilde{} 520 d is found in the radial velocity data, but only in some time spans. A similar period is found in the variations in the equivalent width of Halpha and Ca II. Variations at one-third of this period are also found in the spectral line bisector measurements. The 520 d period is interpreted as the rotation modulation by stellar surface structure. Its presence, however, may not be long-lived, and it only appears in epochs of the radial velocity data separated by \$$\backslash$sim\$ 10 years. This might be due to an activity cycle. The data presented here provide further evidence of a planetary companion to Alpha Tau, as well as activity-related radial velocity variations.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the radial velocity (vr) signatures of 
planets around several solar-like stars highlights the importance of
exploring the sources of vr variations intrinsic to the stars
themselves. We study the stars in the Lick planetary survey for
vr variations related to stellar activity: the rotation of
starspots and convective inhomogeneities and their temporal evolution.
We study the relationships between the weighted vr
dispersion, sigma'v (which has first been
corrected for the orbital contribution from known planets and the mean
internal error), and spectral type, rotation, and activity (as measured
by Ca II H and K). We find that the largest
sigma'v values occur among both the coolest
(dMe) and the warmest (active F) stars. Values of
sigma'v increase with H and K emission and scale
proportional to vsini in G and K stars and proportional to
(vsini)1.3 in F stars. For a G star with vsini \textasciitilde{} 8-10 km
s-1 (age \textasciitilde{}0.3 Gyr), for example, 20 m
s-1$<$\textasciitilde{}sigma'v$<$\textasciitilde{}45 m
s-1, roughly consistent with the predicted
sigma'v levels due to magnetic activity (Saar
\& Donahue). All the stars with proposed planetary companions show
sigma'v values typical for their spectral type,
activity, and/or rotation. However, before the planetary vr
perturbations are removed, these stars show significantly enhanced
sigma'v values. We develop a simple model that
can predict the sigma'v expected for a given
star (within \textasciitilde{}40\%) as a function of vsini, spectral type, photometric
variability, and macroturbulent velocity. The implications for
extrasolar planet searches are discussed.},

  abstract = {Aims: We extend the models presented by Mordasini and 
collaborators to the formation of planets orbiting stars of different
masses. We discuss the properties of the resulting synthetic planet
population in terms of mass, orbit, and metallicity distributions. Methods: The population synthesis calculations that we use are based
on the Bernese planet formation model developed by Alibert and
collaborators, which self-consistently takes into account planetary
growth and migration in an evolving proto-planetary disk. Using this
model, we generate synthetic populations of planets by following their
growth in a large number of proto-planetary disks, whose properties
(mass and lifetime) are selected in a Monte Carlo fashion using
probability distributions derived from observations. Results: We
show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of
the central star has a direct and large influence on the properties of
the resulting planet population. In particular, the observed paucity of
high mass planets orbiting 0.5 M\_\&sun; stars can be directly explained
as resulting from a only slightly steeper than linear scaling. The
observed lack of short period planets orbiting 2.0 M\_\&sun; stars can
also be attributed to this scaling but only if associated with a
decrease in the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive than 1.5
M\_\&sun;. Finally, we show that the distribution of minimum mass and
semi-major axis of our synthetic planets are statistically comparable
with observations.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

  shorttitle = {Disentangling 2},
  abstract = {In radial velocity observations, a pair of extrasolar planets near a 2:1 orbital resonance can be misinterpreted as a single eccentric planet, if data are sparse and measurement precision insufficient to distinguish between these models. We determine the fraction of alleged single-planet RV detected systems for which a 2:1 resonant pair of planets is also a viable model and address the question of how the models can be disentangled. By simulation we quantified the mismatch arising from applying the wrong model. Model alternatives are illustrated using the supposed single-planet system HD 27894 for which we also study the dynamical stability of near-2:1 resonant solutions. From the data scatter around the fitted single-planet Keplerians, we find that for \$74$\backslash$\% \$ of the \$254\$ putative single-planet systems, a 2:1 resonant pair cannot be excluded as a viable model, since the error due to the wrong model is smaller than the scatter. For \$187\$ stars \$$\backslash$chi \^2\$-probabilities can be used to reject the Keplerian models with a confidence of \$95$\backslash$\% \$ for \$54$\backslash$\% \$ of the stars and with \$99.9$\backslash$\% \$ for \$39$\backslash$\% \$ of the stars. For HD 27894 a considerable fit improvement is obtained when adding a low-mass planet near half the orbital period of the known Jovian planet. Dynamical analysis demonstrates that this system is stable when both planets are initially placed on circular orbits. For fully Keplerian orbits a stable system is only obtained if the eccentricity of the inner planet is constrained to \$$<$0.3\$. A large part of the allegedly RV detected single-planet systems should be scrutinized in order to determine the fraction of systems containing near-2:1 resonant pairs of planets. Knowing the abundance of such systems will allow us to revise the eccentricity distribution for extrasolar planets and provide direct constraints for planetary system formation.},

  title = {Dos and Don'ts of Reduced Chi-Squared},
  abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit-like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size ( R p $<$ 1.25 R $\oplus$ ), 288 super-Earth-size (1.25 R $\oplus$ $\leq$ R p $<$ 2 R $\oplus$ ), 662 Neptune-size (2 R $\oplus$ $\leq$ R p $<$ 6 R $\oplus$ ), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R $\oplus$ $\leq$ R p $<$ 15 R $\oplus$ ), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R $\oplus$ $\leq$ R p $<$ 22 R $\oplus$ ). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74\% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5\% for Earth-size candidates, 8\% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18\% for Neptune-size candidates, 2\% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1\% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17\% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 34\% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.},

High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets.

The velocities reveal a planetary companion with orbital period of 2.644 days, eccentricity of 0.12 (consistent with zero), and velocity semiamplitude of K = 18.1 m s -1 . The minimum mass ( M sin i ) for the planet is 0.067 M Jup = 1.2 M Nep = 21 M Earth , making it the lowest mass exoplanet yet found around a main-sequence star and the first candidate in the Neptune-mass domain. GJ 436 (mass = 0.41 M $\Sun$ ) is only the second M dwarf found to harbor a planet, joining the two-planet system around GJ 876. The low mass of the planet raises questions about its constitution, with possible compositions of primarily H and He gas, ice/rock, or rock-dominated. The implied semimajor axis is a = 0.028 AU = 14 stellar radii, raising issues of planet formation, migration, and tidal coupling with the star. GJ 436 is more than 3 Gyr old, based on both kinematic and chromospheric diagnostics. The star exhibits no photometric variability on the 2.644 day Doppler period to a limiting amplitude of 0.0004 mag, supporting the planetary interpretation of the Doppler periodicity. Photometric transits of the planet across the star are ruled out for gas giant compositions and are also unlikely for solid compositions. As the third closest known planetary system, GJ 436 warrants follow-up observations by high-resolution optical and infrared imaging and by the Space Interferometry Mission .},

The latter is well above the measurement precision of 4 micro-arcsecs provided by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). A combination of precise photometric, radial velocity, and astrometric measurements may enable us to derive spot distributions on slowly rotating late-type stars with solar-like levels of activity.},

  abstract = {The radial velocity technique was utilized to make the first exoplanet discoveries and continues to play a major role in the discovery and characterization of exoplanetary systems. In this chapter we describe how the technique works, and the current precision and limitations. We then review its major successes in the field of exoplanets. With more than 250 planet detections, it is the most prolific technique to date and has led to many milestone discoveries, such as hot Jupiters, multi-planet systems, transiting planets around bright stars, the planet-metallicity correlation, planets around M dwarfs and intermediate-mass stars, and recently, the emergence of a population of low-mass planets: ice giants and super-Earths. In the near future radial velocities are expected to systematically explore the domain of telluric and icy planets down to a few Earth masses close to the habitable zone of their parent star. They will also be used to provide the necessary follow-up observations of transiting candidates detected by space missions. Finally, we also note alternative radial velocity techniques that may play an important role in the future.},

The best-fit microlensing model shows both the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can be combined to obtain the lens masses of M = 0.060 + 0.028 -0.021 M $\Sun$ for the primary and m = 3.3 + 4.9 -1.6 M $\oplus$ for the planet. However, the observational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, and the radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source star color measurement. As a result, the 2 $\sigma$ limits on the mass ratio and finite source measurements are weak. Nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signal clearly favors a substellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finite source effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. Adaptive optics images taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) NACO instrument are consistent with a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of the main sequence. Follow-up VLT and/or Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) observations will either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-mass lens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. In either case, the lens star, MOA-2007-BLG-192L, is the lowest mass primary known to have a companion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, is probably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest mass pulsar planet.},

  shorttitle = {Habitability of Planets on Eccentric Orbits},
  abstract = {Contrary to Earth, which has a small orbital eccentricity, some exoplanets discovered in the insolation habitable zone (HZ) have high orbital eccentricities (e.g., up to an eccentricity of \$$\backslash$sim0.97\$ for HD\textasciitilde{}20782\textasciitilde{}b). This raises the question of the capacity of these planets to host surface liquid water. In order to assess the habitability of an eccentric planet, the mean flux approximation is often used. It states that a planet on an eccentric orbit is called habitable if it receives on average a flux compatible with the presence of surface liquid water. However, as the planets do experience important insolation variations over one orbit and even spend some time outside the HZ for high eccentricities, the question of their habitability might not be as straightforward. We performed a set of simulations using the Global Climate Model LMDz, exploring the limits of the mean flux approximation when varying the luminosity of the host star and the eccentricity of the planet. We computed the climate of tidally locked ocean covered planets with orbital eccentricity from 0 to 0.9 receiving a mean flux equal to Earth's, around stars of luminosity ranging from \$L\_$\backslash$odot\$ to \$10\^\{-4\}\textasciitilde{}L\_$\backslash$odot\$. Using here a definition of habitability based on the presence of surface liquid water, we find that most of the planets considered can sustain surface liquid water on the dayside with an ice cap on the nightside. However, for high eccentricity and high luminosity, planets cannot sustain surface liquid water during the whole orbital period. They completely freeze at apoastron and when approaching periastron an ocean appears around the substellar point. We conclude that the higher the eccentricity and the higher the luminosity of the star, the less reliable the mean flux approximation.},

spectral type and the metallicity of the stars and can be used to make a
reliable prediction of rotation periods for late K to mid-M dwarfs with
low levels of activity. For some stars in the sample, the measured
spectroscopic rotation periods coincide, or are very close, to the
orbital periods of postulated planets. In such cases, further studies
are needed to clarify whether the associated periodic radial velocity
signals reveal the existence of planets or are due to magnetic activity.},

  abstract = {Tidal Downsizing (TD) is a recently developed planet formation theory that supplements the classical Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model with planet migration inward and tidal disruptions of GI fragments in the inner regions of the disc. Numerical methods for a detailed population synthesis of TD planets are presented here. As an example application, the conditions under which GI fragments collapse faster than they migrate into the inner \$a$\backslash$sim\$ few AU disc are considered. It is found that most gas fragments are tidally or thermally disrupted unless (a) their opacity is \$$\backslash$sim 3\$ orders of magnitude less than the interstellar dust opacity at metallicities typical of the observed giant planets, or (b) the opacity is high but the fragments accrete large dust grains (pebbles) from the disc. Case (a) models produce very low mass solid cores (\$M\_\{$\backslash$rm core\} $<$ 0.1\$ Earth masses) and follow a negative correlation of giant planet frequency with host star metallicity. In contrast, case (b) models produce massive solid cores, correlate positively with host metallicity and explain naturally while giant gas planets are over-abundant in metals.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young (10-17 Myr) A-type star HD 95086. The strong infrared excess of the system indicates that, similar to HR8799, $\beta$ Pic, and
Fomalhaut, the star harbors a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas content of the HD 95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered planet, here we present new optical, infrared, and millimeter observations. We detected no CO emission, excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory reveal a characteristic disk size of \textasciitilde{}6.''0 \texttimes
5.''4 (540 \texttimes{} 490 AU) and disk inclination of \textasciitilde{}25$^\circ$. Assuming
the same inclination for the planet candidate's orbit, its reprojected radial distance from the star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring. The structure of the planetary system at HD 95086 resembles the one around HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modeling implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to 270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4. Our analysis adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks coexist.},

Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 $\mu$m is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 $\mu$m and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites. We also observe variability of unknown origin at 0.6 $\mu$m.
Images from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal a Jupiter-sized planet, perhaps with a surrounding dust disk, orbiting about 115 astronomical units from a nearby main sequence star.

  title = {A {{Transiting Jupiter Analog}}},
  abstract = {Decadal-long radial velocity surveys have recently started to discover analogs to the most influential planet of our solar system, Jupiter. Detecting and characterizing these worlds is expected to shape our understanding of our uniqueness in the cosmos. Despite the great successes of recent transit surveys, Jupiter analogs represent a terra incognita, owing to the strong intrinsic bias of this method against long orbital periods. We here report on the first validated transiting Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e (KOI-490.02), discovered using Kepler archival photometry orbiting the K4-dwarf KIC-3239945. With a radius of \$(0.91$\backslash$pm0.02)\$ \$R\_\{$\backslash$mathrm\{Jup\}\}\$, a low orbital eccentricity (\$0.06\_\{-0.04\}\^\{+0.10\}\$) and an equilibrium temperature of \$(131$\backslash$pm3)\$ K, Kepler-167e bears many of the basic hallmarks of Jupiter. Kepler-167e is accompanied by three Super-Earths on compact orbits, which we also validate, leaving a large cavity of transiting worlds around the habitable-zone. With two transits and continuous photometric coverage, we are able to uniquely and precisely measure the orbital period of this post snow-line planet (\$1071.2323$\backslash$pm0.0006\$ d), paving the way for follow-up of this \$K=11.8\$ mag target.},

Frequency analyses are very important in astronomy today, not least in the ever-growing field of exoplanets, where short-period signals in stellar radial velocity data are investigated. Periodograms are the main (and powerful) tools for this purpose. However, recovering the correct frequencies and assessing the probability of each frequency is not straightforward. Aims: We provide a formalism that is easy to implement in a code, to describe a Bayesian periodogram that includes weights and a constant offset in the data. The relative probability between peaks can be easily calculated with this formalism. We discuss the differences and agreements between the various periodogram
formalisms with simulated examples. Methods: We used the Bayesian probability theory to describe the probability that a full sine function (including weights derived from the errors on the data values and a constant offset) with a specific frequency is present in the data. Results: From the expression for our Baysian generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram (BGLS), we can easily recover the expression for the non-Bayesian version. In the simulated examples we show that this new formalism recovers the underlying periods better than previous versions. A Python-based code is available for the community.

  doi = {10.1017/S1743921306009185},
  abstract = {As high contrast imaging surveys are being designed and carried out to directly detect extrasolar planets around young, nearby stars it is important to carefully evaluate the criteria for selection of target stars, as well as the predicted success of such a survey based on the sensitivity of the AO system used. We have developed a routine to simulate a large number of planets around each potential target star, and determine what fraction can be reliably (5$\sigma$) detected using an AO system's predicted or observed sensitivity curve (the maximum flux ratio between the parent star and a detectable planet as a function of projected radius). Each planet has a randomly assigned semi-major axis, mass, and eccentricity (following extrapolations of detected radial velocity planet power laws), as well as random viewing angles and orbital phase. The orbital parameters give a projected separation for each planet, while the mass is converted into a flux ratio in the appropriate bandpass of the detector using the models of Burrows et al. (2003); this allows the simulated planets to be directly evaluated against the system's sensitivity curve. Since this method requires basic parameters (age, distance, spectral type, apparent magnitude) for each target star, a target list can be constructed that maximizes the likelihood of detecting planets, or competing instrument designs can be evaluated with respect to their predicted success for a given survey. We are already employing this method to select targets for our Simultaneous Differential Imaging (SDI) surveys (Biller et al. 2004), now underway at telescopes in the northern (MMT) and southern hemispheres (VLT).},

We first derive the mapping from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict the distribution of RV observables for the planet population inferred from microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a fiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We find that RV and microlensing surveys have some overlap, specifically for super-Jupiter mass planets ( m p \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 1 M Jup ) with periods between 3-10 yr. However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller frequency than the overall giant planet frequency ( m p \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 0.1 M Jup ) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs with orbits of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 30 yr.},

  abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg 2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4\textendash{}16 mag). It focusses on bright (4\textendash{}11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4\textendash{}10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2\textendash{}3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

  abstract = {We investigate the possibility of constraining the sin i degeneracy of alpha Cen B b -- with orbital period P=3.24 d; a = 0.042 AU; msini = 1.1 M\_earth -- to estimate the true mass of the newly reported terrestrial exoplanet in the nearest stellar system to our Sun. We present detailed numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of the exoplanet in the alpha Cen AB binary system for a range of initial inclinations, eccentricities, and semi-major axes. The system represents a benchmark case for the interplay of the Kozai mechanism, general relativistic and tidal forces. From our simulations, there is only a small boundary in initial inclinations and initial semi-major axes that result in the migration via the Kozai mechanism of alpha Cen B b to its present location. Inside this boundary, the planet orbit is stable for up to 1 Gyr against the Kozai mechanism, and outside this boundary the planet collides with alpha Cen B or is ejected. In our three simulations where the planet migrates in towards the star via the Kozai mechanism, the final inclination is 46-53 degrees relative to the AB orbital plane, lower than the initial inclination of 75 degrees in each case. We discuss inclination constraints from the formation of alpha Cen B b in situ at its present location, migration in a proto-planetary disk, or migration in resonance with additional planets. We conclude that alpha Cen B b probably has a mass of less than 2.7 M\_earth, implying a likely terrestrial composition warranting future confirmation.},

  volume = {49},
  issn = {0098-3004},
  doi = {10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.018},
  abstract = {Many spectral analysis techniques have been designed assuming sequences taken with a constant sampling interval. However, there are empirical time series in the geosciences (sediment cores, fossil abundance data, isotope analysis, \ldots) that do not follow regular sampling because of missing data, gapped data, random sampling or incomplete sequences, among other reasons. In general, interpolating an uneven series in order to obtain a succession with a constant sampling interval alters the spectral content of the series. In such cases it is preferable to follow an approach that works with the uneven data directly, avoiding the need for an explicit interpolation step. The Lomb\textendash{}Scargle periodogram is a popular choice in such circumstances, as there are programs available in the public domain for its computation. One new computer program for spectral analysis improves the standard Lomb\textendash{}Scargle periodogram approach in two ways: (1) It explicitly adjusts the statistical significance to any bias introduced by variance reduction smoothing, and (2) it uses a permutation test to evaluate confidence levels, which is better suited than parametric methods when neighbouring frequencies are highly correlated.

Another novel program for cross-spectral analysis offers the advantage of estimating the Lomb\textendash{}Scargle cross-periodogram of two uneven time series defined on the same interval, and it evaluates the confidence levels of the estimated cross-spectra by a non-parametric computer intensive permutation test. Thus, the cross-spectrum, the squared coherence spectrum, the phase spectrum, and the Monte Carlo statistical significance of the cross-spectrum and the squared-coherence spectrum can be obtained.

Both of the programs are written in ANSI Fortran 77, in view of its simplicity and compatibility. The program code is of public domain, provided on the website of the journal (http://www.iamg.org/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/112/).

Different examples (with simulated and real data) are described in this paper to corroborate the methodology and the implementation of these two new programs.},

We do not find any exoplanets with radii between 2.2 and 3.8 Earth radii with incident flux above 650 times the incident flux on Earth. This gap in the population of exoplanets is explained by evaporation of volatile elements and thus supports the predictions. The confirmation of a hot-super-Earth desert caused by evaporation will add an important constraint on simulations of planetary systems, since they must be able to reproduce the dearth of close-in super-Earths.},

In contrast, at least half the giant or supergiant 'standard' stars were variable in radial velocity. Four and possibly five of the giant standards are probably intrinsic (pulsating) red or yellow variables. Two further standards showed long-period variability suggestive of companions of undetermined mass.

Making sense of this wealth of data requires sophisticated statistical techniques. Fortunately, statistical methodologies have similarly made great strides in recent years. Powerful synergies thus emerge when astronomers and statisticians join in examining astrostatistical problems and approaches. The book begins with an historical overview and tutorial articles on basic cosmology for statisticians and the principles of Bayesian analysis for astronomers. As in earlier volumes in this series, research contributions discussing topics in one field are joined with commentary from scholars in the other. Thus, for example, an overview of Bayesian methods for Poissonian data is joined by discussions of planning astronomical observations with optimal efficiency and nested models to deal with instrumental effects. The principal theme for the volume is the statistical methods needed to model fundamental characteristics of the early universe on its largest scales.},

This effect is particularly of concern for M dwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile rotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in order to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main sequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 solar masses (M4V to M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a fundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially habitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods reached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary habitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 solar masses (M6V to M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets via radial velocities.},

There are 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8 with four, and 1 each with five and six. We characterize the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean-motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of singly transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets with low to moderate mutual inclinations.},

  title = {Exoplanetary {{Detection By Multifractal Spectral Analysis}}},
  abstract = {Owing to technological advances the number of exoplanets discovered has risen dramatically in the last few years. However, when trying to observe Earth analogs, it is often difficult to test the veracity of detection. We have developed a new approach to the analysis of exoplanetary spectral observations based on temporal multifractality, which identifies time scales that characterize planetary orbital motion around the host star. Without fitting spectral data to stellar models, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from noisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of transiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to relate the time scales obtained to primary transit and secondary exoplanet eclipse of the exoplanets. Making use of data obtained with ground-based and space-based observations we have tested our approach on HD 189733b. Moreover, we have investigated the use of this technique in measuring planetary orbital motion via doppler shift detection. Finally, we have analyzed numerical data obtained using the SOAP 2.0 tool, which simulates a stellar spectrum and the influence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one orbital period. We have demonstrated that, so long as the signal-to-noise-ratio \$$\backslash$ge\$ 100, our approach reconstructs the planetary orbital period, as well as the rotation period of a spot on the stellar surface.},

  title = {Using {{Approximate Bayesian Computation}} to {{Probe Multiple Transiting Planet Systems}}},
  abstract = {The large number of multiple transiting planet systems (MTPS) uncovered 
with Kepler suggest a population of well-aligned planetary systems.
Previously, the distribution of transit duration ratios in MTPSs has
been used to place constraints on the distributions of mutual orbital
inclinations and orbital eccentricities in these systems. However,
degeneracies with the underlying number of planets in these systems pose
added challenges and make explicit likelihood functions intractable.
Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) offers an intriguing path
forward. In its simplest form, ABC proposes from a prior on the
population parameters to produce synthetic datasets via a
physically-motivated model. Samples are accepted or rejected based on
how close they come to reproducing the actual observed dataset to some
tolerance. The accepted samples then form a robust and useful
approximation of the true posterior distribution of the underlying
population parameters. We will demonstrate the utility of ABC in
exoplanet populations by presenting new constraints on the mutual
inclination and eccentricity distributions in the Kepler MTPSs. We will
also introduce Simple-ABC, a new open-source Python package designed for
ease of use and rapid specification of general models, suitable for use
in a wide variety of applications in both exoplanet science and
astrophysics as a whole.},

Our extended time series and subsequent analyses of the Ca ii H\&K emission lines show that the host star has an activity cycle of $\sim$13 years. The activity cycle correlates with the purported orbital period of the outer planet, the signature of which is thus likely due to the host star activity.

  abstract = {We introduce a new conservative test for quantifying the consistency of two or more datasets. The test is based on the Bayesian answer to the question, ``How much more probable is it that all my data were generated from the same model system than if each dataset were generated from an independent set of model parameters?''. We make explicit the connection between evidence ratios and the differences in peak chi-squared values, the latter of which are more widely used and more cheaply calculated. Calculating evidence ratios for three cosmological datasets (recent CMB data (WMAP, ACBAR, CBI, VSA), SDSS and the most recent SNe Type 1A data) we find that concordance is favoured and the tightening of constraints on cosmological parameters is indeed justified.},

  abstract = {In contrast to radial velocity (RV) surveys, results from microlensing surveys indicate that giant planets with masses greater than the critical mass for core accretion ( 0.1 M Jup ) are relatively common around low-mass stars. Using the methodology developed in the first paper, we predict the sensitivity of M-dwarf RV surveys to analogs of the population of planets inferred by microlensing. We find that RV surveys should detect a handful of super-Jovian ($>$ M Jup ) planets at the longest periods being probed. These planets are indeed found by RV surveys, implying that the demographic constraints inferred from these two methods are consistent. Finally, we combine the results from both methods to estimate planet frequencies spanning wide regions of parameter space. We find that the frequency of Jupiters and super-Jupiters (1 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim m p sin i / M Jup \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 13) with periods 1 $\leq$ P /days $\leq$ 10 4 is \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/791/2/91/apj498873ieqn1.gif] \$f\_$\backslash$rm J=0.029\^+0.013\_-0.015\$ , a median factor of 4.3 (1.5-14 at 95\% confidence) smaller than the inferred frequency of such planets around FGK stars of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02. However, we find the frequency of all giant planets with 30 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim m p sin i / M $\oplus$ \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 10 4 and 1 $\leq$ P /days $\leq$ 10 4 to be \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/791/2/91/apj498873ieqn2.gif] \$f\_$\backslash$rm G=0.15\^+0.06\_-0.07\$ , only a median factor of 2.2 (0.73-5.9 at 95\% confidence) smaller than the inferred frequency of such planets orbiting FGK stars of 0.31 $\pm$ 0.07. For a more conservative definition of giant planets (50 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim m p sin i / M $\oplus$ \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 10 4 ), we find \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/791/2/91/apj498873ieqn3.gif] \$f\_$\backslash$rm G\^$\backslash$prime =0.11$\backslash$pm 0.05\$ , a median factor of 2.2 (0.73-6.7 at 95\% confidence) smaller than that inferred for FGK stars of 0.25 $\pm$ 0.05. Finally, we find the frequency of all planets with 1 $\leq$ m p sin i / M $\oplus$ $\leq$ 10 4 and 1 $\leq$ P /days $\leq$ 10 4 to be f p = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.5.},

We have established a reservoir of more than 14,000 main-sequence and subgiant stars closer than 110 pc, brighter than V = 10.5, and with 0.4 $<$ B - V $<$ 1.2. Because the fraction of stars with planets is a sensitive function of stellar metallicity, a broadband photometric calibration has been developed to identify a subset of 2000 stars with [Fe/H] $>$ 0.1 dex for this survey. We outline the strategy and report the detection of a planet orbiting the metal-rich G5 IV star HD 88133 with a period of 3.41 days, semivelocity amplitude K = 35.7 m s -1 , and M sin i = 0.29 M J . Photometric observations reveal that HD 88133 is constant on the 3.415 day radial velocity period to a limit of 0.0005 mag. Despite a transit probability of 19.5\%, our photometry rules out the shallow transits predicted by the large stellar radius.},

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than $\sim$50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/801/1/41/apj508914ieqn1.gif] \$1.6$\backslash$;R\_{\o}plus \$ planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of ``Earth-like'' planets, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/801/1/41/apj508914ieqn2.gif] \$$\backslash$eta \_{\o}plus \$ .},

This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

The automated detection of transits in tens of thousands of noisy light curves is a challenging task because of the brief, shallow and rare nature of the sought-after signal. I developed a Bayesian transit detection algorithm and tested it through Monte Carlo simulations. This led to a number of improvements to the algorithm, resulting in a maximum likelihood box-fitting approach that is simpler and, for detection purposes, more effective. I also developed an empirical model of the intrinsic micro-variability of the parent stars, which constitutes one of the main performance limitations for space-based transit searches, and used this model to optimise variability filters. These tools were used to identify optimal regions of the stellar parameter space to be targeted by missions such as CoRoT and Eddington, through Monte Carlo simulations and participation in the first CoRoT blind transit detection exercise. Recently, the same tools have been used to analyse ground-based data from the University of New South Wales planet search project, leading to the identification of several potential transiting planet candidates.},

In a group of stars with individual spectral types from G2 to K7, the cycle periods were consistent with the relation P(cyc) is approximately equal to (P rot/tauc) exp n, where tauc is the convective turnover time near the bottom of the convection zone. On the basis of the above relations, it is suggested that an increase of P(cyc) with increasing P(rot) does not agree with conventional estimates from nonlinear dynamo models, and is limited by two factors: the quenching of the alpha effect; and differential rotation.},

  abstract = {We conducted a Doppler survey at Keck combined with NIRC2 K-band AO imaging to search for massive, long-period companions to 123 known exoplanet systems with one or two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter mass planets out to 20 AU for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends indicating the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 AU. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 +/- 5\% over the range 1 - 20 M\_Jup and 5 - 20 AU. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 AU, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 AU. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3-10 AU, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall gas giant planet population. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

However their characteristics and formation mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The metallicity of the host star is a critical parameter in such processes and can impact the occurrence rate or physical properties of these planets. While a frequency\textendash{}metallicity correlation has been found for giant planets, this is still an ongoing debate for their smaller counterparts. Using the published parameters of a sample of 157 exoplanets lighter than 40 M$\oplus$, we explore the mass-metallicity space of Neptunes and super-Earths. We show the existence of a maximal mass that increases with metallicity, that also depends on the period of these planets. This seems to favour in situ formation or alternatively a metallicity-driven migration mechanism. It also suggests that the frequency of Neptunes (between 10 and 40 M$\oplus$) is, like giant planets, correlated with the host star metallicity, whereas no correlation is found for super-Earths ($<$10 M$\oplus$).},

  abstract = {A re-analysis of Gliese 667C HARPS precision radial velocity data was carried out with a Bayesian multi-planet Kepler periodogram (from 0 to 7 planets) based on a fusion Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The most probable number of signals detected is 6 with a Bayesian false alarm probability of 0.012. The residuals are shown to be consistent with white noise. The 6 signals detected include two previously reported with periods of 7.198 (b) and 28.14 (c) days, plus additional periods of 30.82 (d), 38.82 (e), 53.22, and 91.3 (f) days. The 53 day signal is probably the second harmonic of the stellar rotation period and is likely the result of surface activity. The existence of the additonal Keplerian signals suggest the possibilty of further planets, two of which (d and e) could join Gl 667Cc in the central region of the habitable zone. N-body simulations are required to determine which of these signals are consistent with a stable planetary system. \$M $\backslash$sin i\$ values corresponding to signals b, c, d, e, and f are \$$\backslash$sim\$ 5.4, 4.8, 3.1, 2.4, and 5.4 M\$\_\{$\backslash$earth\}\$, respectively.},

Around M-dwarf stars (the most common stars in our Galaxy), this model favours the formation of Earth-mass (M) to Neptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (au), which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbit M-dwarf host stars. More than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered with a wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of Neptune's mass or less have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 au from normal stars. Here we report the discovery of a M planetary companion at a separation of au from a M M-dwarf star, where M refers to a solar mass. (We propose to name it OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensing event.) The mass is lower than that of GJ876d (ref. 5), although the error bars overlap. Our detection suggests that such cool, sub-Neptune-mass planets may be more common than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.},

  shorttitle = {Star-Planet Interactions},
  abstract = {Context. As a star evolves, the planet orbits change with time due to tidal interactions, stellar mass losses, friction and gravitational drag forces, mass accretion and evaporation on/by the planet. Stellar rotation modifies the structure of the star and therefore the way these different processes occur. Changes of the orbits, at their turn, have an impact on the rotation of the star. Aims. Models accounting in a consistent way for these interactions between the orbital evolution of the planet and the evolution of the rotation of the star are still missing. The present work is a first attempt to fill this gap. Methods. We compute the evolution of stellar models including a comprehensive treatment of rotational effects together with the evolution of planetary orbits, so that the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the planetary orbit are treated in a self-consistent way. The evolution of the rotation of the star accounts for the angular momentum exchange with the planet and also follows the effects of the internal transport of angular momentum and chemicals. Results. We show that rotating stellar models without tidal interactions can well reproduce the surface rotations of the bulk of the red giants. However, models without any interactions cannot account for fast rotating red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch, where, such models, whatever the initial rotation considered on the ZAMS, always predict very low velocities. For those stars some interaction with a companion is highly probable and the present rotating stellar models with planets confirm that tidal interaction can reproduce their high surface velocities. We show also that the minimum distance between the planet and the star on the ZAMS that will allow the planet to avoid engulfment and survive is decreased around faster rotating stars. [abridged]},

each star in our sample. We identify several long-term, low-amplitude RV
variables worthy of followup with direct imaging techniques. We place
lower limits on the detectable companion mass as a function of orbital
period. Our survey would have detected, with a 99.5\% confidence level,
over 95\% of all companions on low-eccentricity orbits with velocity
semiamplitude K gsim 100 m s-1, or Mp sin i gsim
3.0 M J(P/yr)(1/3), for orbital periods P lsim 3
yr. None of the stars in our sample exhibits RV variations compatible
with the presence of Jovian planets with periods shorter than the survey
duration. The resulting average frequency of gas giants orbiting
metal-poor dwarfs with -2.0lsim[Fe/H]lsim-0.6 is fp $<$
0.67\% (at the 1sigma confidence level). We examine the implications of
this null result in the context of the observed correlation between the
rate of occurrence of giant planets and the metallicity of their
main-sequence solar-type stellar hosts. By combining our data set with
the Fischer \& Valenti (2005) uniform sample, we confirm that the
likelihood of a star to harbor a planet more massive than Jupiter within
2 AU is a steeply rising function of the host's metallicity. However,
the data for stars with -1.0lsim[Fe/H]lsim0.0 are compatible, in a
statistical sense, with a constant occurrence rate fp sime

of giant-planet formation across two orders of magnitude in metallicity.},

We apply the algorithms to a suite of numerical simulations of (single and multiple) low-amplitude Keplerian RV signals induced by low-mass companions around M-dwarf primaries. The global performance of the three period search approaches is quite similar in the limit of an idealized, best-case scenario (single planets, circular orbits, white noise). However, GLS, BGLS and FREDEC are not equivalent when it comes to the correct identification of more complex signals (including correlated noise of stellar origin, eccentric orbits, multiple planets), with variable degrees of efficiency loss as a function of system parameters and degradation in completeness and reliability levels. The largest discrepancy is recorded in the number of false detections: the standard approach of residual analyses adopted for GLS and BGLS translates in large fractions of false alarms (\$$\backslash$sim30$\backslash$\%\$) in the case of multiple systems, as opposed to \$$\backslash$sim10$\backslash$\%\$ for the FREDEC approach of simultaneous multi-frequency search. Our results reinforce the need for the strengthening and further development of the most aggressive and effective \{$\backslash$it ab initio\} strategies for the robust identification of low-amplitude planetary signals in RV datasets, particularly now that RV surveys are beginning to achieve sensitivity to potentially habitable Earth-mass planets around late-type stars.},

  abstract = {The origin of hot Jupiters\textemdash{}gas giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their host stars\textemdash{}is a long-standing puzzle. Planet formation theories suggest that such planets are unlikely to have formed in situ but instead may have formed at large orbital separations beyond the snow line and migrated inward to their present orbits. Two competing hypotheses suggest that the planets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during their formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions with a third body. Observations of eccentricities and spin-orbit misalignments of hot Jupiter systems have been unable to differentiate between the two hypotheses. In the present work, we suggest that chemical depletions in hot Jupiter atmospheres might be able to constrain their migration mechanisms. We find that sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances in Jovian-mass hot Jupiters around Sun-like stars are hard to explain by disk migration. Instead, such abundances are more readily explained by giant planets forming at large orbital separations, either by core accretion or gravitational instability, and migrating to close-in orbits via disk-free mechanisms involving dynamical encounters. Such planets also contain solar or super-solar C/O ratios. On the contrary, hot Jupiters with super-solar O and C abundances can be explained by a variety of formation-migration pathways which, however, lead to solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Current estimates of low oxygen abundances in hot Jupiter atmospheres may be indicative of disk-free migration mechanisms. We discuss open questions in this area which future studies will need to investigate.},

  abstract = {Radial velocity observations of the F8 V star $\upsilon$ Andromedae taken at Lick and at Whipple Observatories have revealed evidence of three periodicities in the line-of-sight velocity of the star. These periodicities have been interpreted as evidence for at least three low-mass companions (LMCs) revolving around $\upsilon$ Andromedae. The mass and orbital parameters inferred for these companions raise questions about the dynamical stability of the system. We report here results from our independent analysis of the published radial velocity data, as well as new unpublished data taken at Lick Observatory. Our results confirm the finding of three periods in the data. Our best fits to the data, on the assumption that these periods arise from the gravitational perturbations of companions in Keplerian orbits, are also generally in agreement but with some differences from the earlier findings. We find that the available data do not constrain well the orbital eccentricity of the middle companion in a three-companion model of the data. We also find that in order for our best-fit model to the Lick data to be dynamically stable over the lifetime of the star ( 2 billion years), the system must have a mean inclination to the plane of the sky greater than 13$^\circ$. The corresponding minimum inclination for the best fit to the Whipple data set is 19$^\circ$. These values imply that the maximum mass for the outer companion can be no greater than about 20 Jupiter masses. Our analysis of the stability of the putative systems also places constraints on the relative inclinations of the orbital planes of the companions. We comment on global versus local (i.e., method of steepest descent) means of finding best-fit orbits from radial velocity data sets.},

  title = {Metal Loading of Giant Gas Planets},
  abstract = {One of many challenges in forming giant gas planets via Gravitational disc Instability model (GI) is an inefficient radiative cooling of the pre-collapse fragments. Since fragment contraction times are as long at \$10\^5 -10\^7\$ years, the fragments may be tidally destroyed sooner than they contract into gas giant planets. Here we explore the role of "pebble accretion" onto the pre-collapse giant planets and find an unexpected result. Despite larger dust opacity at higher metallicities, addition of metals actually accelerates -- rather than slows down -- collapse of high opacity, relatively low mass giant gas planets (\$M\_p\$ below a few Jupiter masses). A simple analytical theory that explains this result exactly in idealised simplified cases is presented. The theory shows that planets with the central temperature in the range between \$$\backslash$sim\$ 1000 to 2000K are especially sensitive to pebble accretion: addition of just \$$\backslash$sim 5\$ to 10 \% of metals by weight is sufficient to cause their collapse. These results show that dust grain physics and dynamics is essential for an accurate modelling of self-gravitating disc fragments and their near environments in the outer massive and cold protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {The nearby (6.5 pc) star HD 219134 was recently shown by Motalebi et al. (2015) and Vogt et al. (2015) to host several planets, the innermost of which is transiting. We present twenty-seven years of radial velocity observations of this star from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search program, and nineteen years of stellar activity data. We detect a long-period activity cycle measured in the Ca II \$S\_\{HK\}\$ index, with a period of \$4230 $\backslash$pm 100\$ days (11.7 years), very similar to the 11-year Solar activity cycle. Although the period of the Saturn-mass planet HD 219134 h is close to half that of the activity cycle, we argue that it is not an artifact due to stellar activity. We also find a significant periodicity in the \$S\_\{HK\}\$ data due to stellar rotation with a period of 22.8 days. This is identical to the period of planet f identified by Vogt et al. (2015), suggesting that this radial velocity signal might be caused by rotational modulation of stellar activity rather than a planet. Analysis of our radial velocities allows us to detect the long-period planet HD 219134 h and the transiting super-Earth HD 219134 b. Finally, we use our long time baseline to constrain the presence of longer-period planets in the system, excluding to \$1$\backslash$sigma\$ objects with \$M$\backslash$sin i$>$0.36 M\_J\$ at 12 years (corresponding to the orbital period of Jupiter) and \$M$\backslash$sin i$>$0.72 M\_J\$ at a period of 16.4 years (assuming a circular orbit for an outer companion).},

Owing to the small angular separation between the two components of the $\alpha$ Cen AB binary system, the observations will to some extent be contaminated with light coming from the other star. We are accurately determining the amount of contamination for every observation by measuring the relative strengths of the H-$\alpha$ and NaD lines. Furthermore, we have developed a modified version of a well-established Doppler code that is modelling the observations using two stellar templates simultaneously. With this method we can significantly reduce the scatter of the radial velocity (RV) measurements due to spectral cross-contamination and hence increase our chances of detecting the tiny signature caused by potential Earth-mass planets. After correcting for the contamination we achieve RV precision of 2.5 m s-1 for a given night of observations. We have also applied this new Doppler code to four southern double-lined spectroscopic binary systems (HR159, HR913, HR7578 and HD181958) and have successfully recovered radial velocities for both components simultaneously.},

We include the recent Keck/HIRES measurements as well as the aged but much more numerous CORALIE data. We find that the CORALIE radial velocity measurements are polluted by a systematic annual variation which affected the robustness of many previous results. We show that after purging this variation, the residuals still contain a clear signature of an additional \$$\backslash$sim 1100\$ days periodicity. The latter variation leaves significant hints in all three independent radial velocity subsets that we analysed: the CORALIE data, the Keck data acquired prior to a hardware upgrade, and the Keck data taken after the upgrade. We mainly treat this variation as a signature of a third planet in the system, although we cannot rule out other interpretations, such as long-term stellar activity. We find it easy to naturally obtain a stable three-planet radial-velocity fit close to the three-planet mean-motion resonance 1:2:5, with the two main planets (those in the 1:2 resonance) in an aligned apsidal corotation. The dynamical status of the third planet is still uncertain: it may reside in as well as slightly out of the 5:2 resonance. We obtain the value of \$$\backslash$sim 1075\$ days for its orbital period and of \$$\backslash$sim 0.3 M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ for its minimum mass, while the eccentric parameters are uncertain.},

  abstract = {We have conducted a set of experiments aimed at improving our knowledge of the formation, migration, and evolution processes of gas giant planets, utilizing a combination of spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric techniques.First, the distributions of planet masses and orbital elements, different correlations among them, and measurable differences in planetary frequency are likely to be generated by diverse planetary formation scenarios and evolution mechanisms as well as different characteristics of the parent star (binarity, spectral type metallicity, age). We have found new evidence for a correlation between the orbital periods of extrasolar planets and the metallicity of the host stars. We have undertaken a precision radial-velocity survey of a sample of 200 metal-poor stars, to confirm or disprove the correlation, to refine our understanding of the dependence of planetary frequency on the metallicity of the host stars, and to put constraints on proposed models of giant planet formation.Second, the internal structure and composition of the atmospheres of close-in giant planets can be better understood if measurements of their radii and actual masses are available, for a range of different planet host spectral types. We have measured the spectroscopic orbit of TrES-1, the transiting Jupiter-sized planet of a moderately bright K0V star, and by improving on the determination of the stellar parameters, we havederived accurate estimates of its radius and mass.Finally, the actual source responsible for eccentricity excitation could be understood andthe long-term dynamical evolution better characterized if coplanarity measurements of multiple-planet orbits were to be carried out. We have quantified the ability of the Space Interferometry Mission to obtain accuratemeasurements of the actual masses, orbital parameters, and relative inclination angles for systems of giant planets around stars in the solar neighborhood.We conclude describing four experiments to investigate further the transiting planet TrES-1 and its parent star. These are: 1) infrared observations of the secondary eclipse; 2) high-precision visible wavelength observations of the primary eclipse; 3) a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the host star; 4) a direct distance measurement for the system.},

First, we show that the most likely formation mechanism requires the destruction of a companion star. Only pulsars with a suitable companion (with an extreme mass ratio) are able to form planets. Second, while a dead zone (a region of low turbulence) in the disk is generally thought to be essential for planet formation, it is most probably rare in disks around pulsars, because of the irradiation from the pulsar. The irradiation strongly heats the inner parts of the disk, thus pushing the inner boundary of the dead zone out. We suggest that the rarity of pulsar planets can be explained by the low probability for these two requirements to be satisfied: a very low-mass companion and a dead zone.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that at low metallicities Doppler-detected 
planet-hosting stars tend to have high $\alpha$-content and to belong to
the thick disk. We used the reconnaissance spectra of 87 Kepler planet
candidates and data available from the HARPS planet search survey to
explore this phenomenon. Using the traditional spectroscopic abundance
analysis methods, we derived Ti, Ca, and Cr abundances for the Kepler
stars. In the metallicity region -0.65 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -0.3 dex, the
fraction of Ti-enhanced thick-disk HARPS planet harboring stars is 12.3
$\pm$ 4.1\%, and for their thin-disk counterparts this fraction is 2.2
$\pm$ 1.3\%. Binomial statistics give a probability of 0.008 that this
could have occurred by chance. Combining the two samples (HARPS and
Kepler) reinforces the significance of this result (P \textasciitilde{} 99.97\%). Since
most of these stars harbor small sized or low-mass planets we can assume
that, although terrestrial planets can be found in a low-iron regime,
they are mostly enhanced by $\alpha$-elements. This implies that early
formation of rocky planets could start in the Galactic thick disk, where
the chemical conditions for their formation are more favorable.

  abstract = {We report the discovery of eight new giant planets, and updated orbits for four known planets, orbiting dwarf and subgiant stars, using the CORALIE, HARPS, and MIKE instruments as part of the Calan-Hertfordshire Extrasolar Planet Search. We include radial velocity data prior- and post-2014 CORALIE upgrade and our Bayesian updating method returned a systematic offset of 19.2\$$\backslash$pm\$4.8 m/s between the two velocity sets for our stars. The planets have masses in the range 1.1-5.4M\$\_\{$\backslash$rm\{J\}\}\$s, orbital periods from 40-2900 days, and eccentricities from 0.0-0.6. They include a double-planet system orbiting the most massive star in our sample (HD147873), two eccentric giant planets (HD128356\$b\$ and HD154672\$b\$), and a rare 14\textasciitilde{}Herculis analogue (HD224538\$b\$). We find that there is an over-abundance of Jupiter-mass objects compared to a simple power law fit to the mass function, with a steep increase in the planet frequency around 3M\$\_\{$\backslash$rm\{J\}\}\$, reflecting the increased efficiency of planet formation towards lower masses. We show that an exponential function provides a better fit to the data. This truncation of the mass function could provide the sought after upper limit of planetary-masses that can be formed by gas accretion onto a forming proto-planet, constraining future hydrodynamical models. We also confirm the growing body of evidence that low-mass planets tend to be found orbiting more metal-poor stars than giant planets, yet the functional form of the mass distribution does not change with metallicity. Finally, we observe a possible period-metallicity correlation and speculate on its origin.},

The focus is on two methods of marginal likelihood estimation. First, a statistical failure of the widely employed Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator is highlighted. It is demonstrated that there is a systematic bias capable of significantly skewing Bayes factor estimates, which has not previously been highlighted in the literature. Second, a detailed study of the recently proposed Thermodynamic Integral estimator is presented, which characterises the error associated with its discrete form. An experimental study using analytically tractable linear regression models highlights substantial differences with recently published results regarding optimal discretisation. Finally, with the insights gained, it is demonstrated how Population MCMC and thermodynamic integration methods may be elegantly combined to estimate Bayes factors accurately enough to discriminate between nonlinear models based on systems of ODEs, which has important application in describing the behaviour of complex processes arising in a wide variety of research areas, such as Systems Biology, Computational Ecology and Chemical Engineering.},

  abstract = {Radial velocity planet searches have revealed that many giant planets have large eccentricities, in striking contrast with the giant planets in the solar system and prior theories of planet formation. The realization that many giant planets have large eccentricities raises a fundamental question: Do terrestrial-size planets of other stars typically have significantly eccentric orbits or nearly circular orbits like the Earth? While space-based missions such as CoRoT and Kepler will be capable of detecting nearly Earth-sized planets, it will be extremely challenging to measure their eccentricities using radial velocity observations. We review several ways that photometric measurements of transit light curves can constrain the eccentricity of transiting planets. In particular, photometric observations of transit durations can be used to characterize the distribution of orbital eccentricities for various populations of transiting planets (e.g., nearly Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone) without relying on radial velocity measurements. Applying this technique to rocky planets to be found by CoRoT and Kepler will enable constraints on theories for the excitation of eccentricities and tidal dissipation. We also remind observers that several short-period transiting planets are known to have significant eccentricities and caution that assuming they are on a circular orbit can reduce the probability of detecting transits, impact planning for follow-up observations, and adversely affect measurements of the physical parameters of the star and planet.},

  title = {Prevalence of {{Earth}}-Size {{Planets Orbiting Sun}}-like {{Stars}}},
  abstract = {In this thesis, I explore two topics in exoplanet science. The first is the prevalence of Earth-size planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. To determine the occurrence of planets having different sizes, orbital periods, and other properties, I conducted a survey of extrasolar planets using data collected by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. This project involved writing new algorithms to analyze Kepler data, finding planets, and conducting follow-up work using ground-based telescopes. I found that most stars have at least one planet at or within Earth's orbit and that 26\% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet with an orbital period of 100 days or less. The second topic is the connection between the properties of planets and their host stars. The precise characterization of exoplanet hosts helps to bring planet properties like mass, size, and equilibrium temperature into sharper focus and probes the physical processes that form planets. I studied the abundance of carbon and oxygen in over 1000 nearby stars using optical spectra taken by the California Planet Search. I found a large range in the relative abundance of carbon and oxygen in this sample, including a handful of carbon-rich stars. I also developed a new technique called SpecMatch for extracting fundamental stellar parameters from optical spectra. SpecMatch is particularly applicable to the relatively faint planet-hosting stars discovered by Kepler.},

  abstract = {The quest for Earth-like planets is a major focus of current exoplanet research. Although planets that are Earth-sized and smaller have been detected, these planets reside in orbits that are too close to their host star to allow liquid water on their surfaces. We present the detection of Kepler-186f, a 1.11 $\pm$ 0.14 Earth-radius planet that is the outermost of five planets, all roughly Earth-sized, that transit a 0.47 $\pm$ 0.05 solar-radius star. The intensity and spectrum of the star's radiation place Kepler-186f in the stellar habitable zone, implying that if Kepler-186f has an Earth-like atmosphere and water at its surface, then some of this water is likely to be in liquid form.
Starry Brightness
The high photometric precision of NASA's Kepler observatory has enabled the detection of many planets because they cause slight dimming of their host stars as they orbit in front of them. From these data, Quintana et al. (p. 277) have spotted a five-planet system around a small star. Here, the outermost planet is only 10\% larger than Earth and completes its 130-day orbit entirely within the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on its surface. Similarly, Kepler can detect faint periodic brightenings, as Kruse and Agol (p. 275) have reported for the binary system KOI-3278. In this system, a white dwarf acts as a gravitational microlens when it passes in front of its Sun-like G-star companion every 88 days. The lensing effect allows the mass of the white dwarf to be estimated, which helps us to understand how similar binary systems may have evolved.},

Gravitational microlensing, on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10\,au (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that nature10684-m1jpg20K4820 of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10\,MJ, where MJ = 318\,M$\oplus$ and M$\oplus$ is Earth/'s mass).

  abstract = {Thousands of extrasolar planets have been discovered, and it is clear that the galactic planetary census draws on a diversity greatly exceeding that exhibited by the solar system's planets. We review significant landmarks in the chronology of extrasolar planet detection, and we give an overview of the varied observational techniques that are brought to bear. We then discuss the properties of the currently known distribution, using the mass-period diagram as a guide to delineating hot Jupiters, eccentric giant planets, and a third, highly populous, category that we term "ungiants", planets having masses less than 30 Earth masses and orbital periods less than 100 days. We then move to a discussion of the bulk compositions of the extrasolar planets. We discuss the long-standing problem of radius anomalies among giant planets, as well as issues posed by the unexpectedly large range in sizes observed for planets with masses somewhat greater than Earth's. We discuss the use of transit observations to probe the atmospheres of extrasolar planets; various measurements taken during primary transit, secondary eclipse, and through the full orbital period, can give clues to the atmospheric compositions, structures, and meteorologies. The extrasolar planet catalog, along with the details of our solar system and observations of star-forming regions and protoplanetary disks, provide a backdrop for a discussion of planet formation in which we review the elements of the favored pictures for how the terrestrial and giant planets were assembled. We conclude by listing several research questions that are relevant to the next ten years and beyond.},

We study potential correlations between the existence of planetary companions and the relative elemental abundances of their host stars. We use a large sample of FGK-type dwarf stars for which precise Mg, Si, and Fe abundances have been derived using HARPS high-resolution and high-quality data. A first analysis of the data suggests that low-mass planet host stars show higher [Mg/Si] ratios, while giant planet hosts present [Mg/Si] that is lower than field stars. However, we found that the [Mg/Si] ratio significantly depends on metallicity through Galactic chemical evolution. After removing the Galactic evolution trend only the difference in the [Mg/Si] elemental ratio between low-mass planet hosts and non-hosts was present in a significant way. These results suggests that low-mass planets are more prevalent around stars with high [Mg/Si]. Our results demonstrate the importance of Galactic chemical evolution and indicate that it may play an important role in the planetary internal structure and composition.},

  title = {Earth and {{Terrestrial Planet Formation}}},
  abstract = {The growth and composition of Earth is a direct consequence of planet formation throughout the Solar System. We discuss the known history of the Solar System, the proposed stages of growth and how the early stages of planet formation may be dominated by pebble growth processes. Pebbles are small bodies whose strong interactions with the nebula gas lead to remarkable new accretion mechanisms for the formation of planetesimals and the growth of planetary embryos. Many of the popular models for the later stages of planet formation are presented. The classical models with the giant planets on fixed orbits are not consistent with the known history of the Solar System, fail to create a high Earth/Mars mass ratio, and, in many cases, are also internally inconsistent. The successful Grand Tack model creates a small Mars, a wet Earth, a realistic asteroid belt and the mass-orbit structure of the terrestrial planets. In the Grand Tack scenario, growth curves for Earth most closely match a Weibull model. The feeding zones, which determine the compositions of Earth and Venus follow a particular pattern determined by Jupiter, while the feeding zones of Mars and Theia, the last giant impactor on Earth, appear to randomly sample the terrestrial disk. The late accreted mass samples the disk nearly evenly.},

Both are massive, evolved stars that exhibit periodic variations due to the presence of a pair of Jovian planets. Photometric monitoring with the T12 0.80 m APT at Fairborn Observatory demonstrates both stars to be constant in brightness to $\leq$0.002 mag, thus strengthening the planetary interpretation of the RV variations. Based on our dynamical analysis of the RV time series, 24 Sex b, c have orbital periods of 452.8 days and 883.0 days, corresponding to semimajor axes 1.333 AU and 2.08 AU, and minimum masses 1.99 M Jup and 0.86 M Jup , assuming a stellar mass M \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] sstarf = 1.54 M $\Sun$ .

We also carry out dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactions between the planets. Most, if not all, of the dynamically stable solutions include crossing orbits, suggesting that each system is locked in a mean-motion resonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability. The planets in the 24 Sex system likely have a period ratio near 2:1, while the HD 200964 system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4:3. However, we caution that further RV observations and more detailed dynamical modeling will be required to provide definitive and unique orbital solutions for both cases, and to determine whether the two systems are truly resonant.},

  abstract = {No true extrasolar Earth analog is known. Hundreds of planets have been 
found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter
periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong
assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated
estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These
studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by
non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every
property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a
general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified
inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account
survey completeness and, for the first time, observational
uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the
distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence
rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a
Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we
demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole
population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse
detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of
small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous
result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius.
We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star
per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large
uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made
with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of the transiting super-Earth CoRoT-7b, several investigations have yielded different results for the number and masses of planets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level of activity. We re-observed CoRoT-7 in 2012 January with both HARPS and CoRoT, so that we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric data. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's light curve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression of convective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. To account for activity-related effects in the radial velocities which do not have a photometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to make a precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure the masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 $\pm$ 0.95 and 13.56 $\pm$ 1.08
M$\oplus$, respectively. The density of CoRoT-7b is (6.61

  abstract = {We analyze data from the Quarter 1-17 Data Release 24 (Q1--Q17 DR24) planet candidate catalog from NASA's Kepler mission, specifically comparing systems with single transiting planets to systems with multiple transiting planets, and identify a distinct population of exoplanets with a necessarily distinct system architecture. Such an architecture likely indicates a different branch in their evolutionary past relative to the typical Kepler system. The key feature of these planetary systems is an isolated, Earth-sized planet with a roughly one-day orbital period. We estimate that at least 24 of the 144 systems we examined ($>$\textasciitilde{}17\%) are members of this population. Accounting for detection efficiency, such planetary systems occur with a frequency similar to the hot Jupiters.},

In particular, we reanalyze the data for HD 202206, 14 Her, HD 37124, and HD 108874. We derive dynamically stable configurations that reproduce the observed RV signals, using GAMP (the genetic algorithm with MEGNO penalty). GAMP relies on N -body dynamics and makes use of genetic algorithms merged with a stability criterion. For this purpose, we use the maximal Lyapunov exponent computed with the dynamical fast indicator MEGNO. Through a dynamical analysis of the phase space in a neighborhood of the obtained best-fit solutions, we derive meaningful limits on the parameters of the planets. We demonstrate that GAMP is especially well suited to the analysis of the RV data that only partially cover the longest orbital period and/or are related to multiplanet configurations involved in low-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). Our analysis reveals a presence of a second Jupiter-like planet in the 14 Her system (14 Her c) that is involved in a 3 : 1 or 6 : 1 MMR with the known companion 14 Her b. We also show that the dynamics of the HD 202206 system may be qualitatively different when coplanar and mutually inclined orbits of the companions are considered. We demonstrate that the two outer planets in the HD 37124 system may reside in a close neighborhood of the 5 : 2 MMR. Our results confirm that the HD 108874 system may be very close to a, or locked in an exact, 4 : 1 MMR.},

28 m s-1 yr-1 observed during 8 years. The
combination of the radial-velocity data and the non-detection of any
main sequence stellar companion in our high contrast images, taken at
the VLT with NACO/SDI, characterizes the companion as a probable brown
dwarf or as a faint white dwarf. The second planet, HD 156846

HD 156846 is a metal rich G0 dwarf and is also the
primary of a wide binary system (a$>$250 AU, P$>$4000 years). Its
stellar companion, IDS 17147-1914 B, is a M4 dwarf.
The very high eccentricities of both planets can be explained by Kozai
oscillations induced by the presence of a third object.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00159-009-0025-1},
  abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and alpha Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of $\pm$3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except alpha Aur). We discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

  abstract = {In this article we present the case of HD 41004 AB, a system composed of 
a K0V star and a 3.7-mag fainter M-dwarf companion. We have obtained 86
CORALIE spectra of this system with the goal of obtaining precise
radial-velocity measurements. Since HD 41004 A and B are separated by
only 0.5$\backslash$arcsec, in every spectrum taken for the radial-velocity
measurement, we are observing the blended spectra of the two stars. An
analysis of the measurements has revealed a velocity variation with an
amplitude of about 50 m s-1 and a periodicity of 1.3 days.
This radial-velocity signal is consistent with the expected variation
induced by the presence of a companion to either HD 41004 A or HD 41004
B, or to some other effect due to e.g. activity related phenomena. In
particular, such a small velocity amplitude could be the signature of
the presence of a very low mass giant planetary companion to HD 41004 A,
whose light dominates the spectra. The radial-velocity measurements were
then complemented with a photometric campaign and with the analysis of
the bisector of the CORALIE Cross-Correlation Function (CCF). While the
former revealed no significant variations within the observational
precision of \textasciitilde{} 0.003-0.004 mag (except for an observed flare event), the
bisector analysis showed that the line profiles are varying in phase
with the radial-velocity. This latter result, complemented with a series
of simulations, has shown that we can explain the observations by
considering that HD 41004 B has a brown-dwarf companion orbiting with
the observed 1.3-day period. As the spectrum of the fainter HD 41004 B
``moves'' relative to the one of HD 41004 A (with an amplitude of a few
km s-1), the relative position of the spectral lines of the
two spectra changes, thus changing the blended line-profiles. This
variation is large enough to explain the observed radial-velocity and
bisector variations, and is compatible with the absence of any
photometric signal. If confirmed, this detection represents the first
discovery of a brown dwarf in a very short period (1.3-day) orbit around
an M dwarf. Finally, this case should be taken as a serious warning
about the importance of analyzing the bisector when looking for planets
using radial-velocity techniques. Based on observations collected at the
La Silla Observatory, ESO (Chile), with the CORALIE spectrograph at the
1.2-m Euler Swiss telescope and with the Str{\"o}mgren Automatic

  abstract = {With the rapid developments in the exoplanet field, more and more terrestrial exoplanets are being detected. Characterizing their atmospheres using transit observations will become a key datum in the quest for detecting an Earth-like exoplanet. The atmospheric transmission spectrum of our Earth will be an ideal template for comparison with future exo-Earth candidates. By observing a lunar eclipse, which offers a similar configuration to that of an exoplanet transit, we have obtained a high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) transmission spectrum of the Earth's atmosphere. This observation was performed with the High Resolution Spectrograph at Xinglong Station, China during the total lunar eclipse in December 2011. We compare the observed transmission spectrum with our atmospheric model, and determine the characteristics of the various atmospheric species in detail. In the transmission spectrum, O2, O3, O2 $\cdot$ O2, NO2 and H2O are detected, and their column densities are measured and compared with the satellites data. The visible Chappuis band of ozone produces the most prominent absorption feature, which suggests that ozone is a promising molecule for the future exo-Earth characterization. Due to the high resolution and high SNR of our spectrum, several novel details of the Earth atmosphere's transmission spectrum are presented. The individual O2 lines are resolved and O2 isotopes are clearly detected. Our new observations do not confirm the absorption features of Ca II or Na I which have been reported in previous lunar eclipse observations. However, features in these and some other strong Fraunhofer line positions do occur in the observed spectrum. We propose that these are due to a Raman-scattered component in the forward-scattered sunlight appearing in the lunar umbral spectrum. Water vapour absorption is found to be rather weak in our spectrum because the atmosphere we probed is relatively dry, which prompts us to discuss the detectability of water vapour in Earth-like exoplanet atmospheres.},

rather promising time ranges can be found. Observations of the near
future may give rather remarkable improvement of the orbital fit, but

According to this model, gas giants formed and acquired their mass Mp through planetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas is accreted. These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semimajor axis a through tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the observed properties of protostellar disks, we generate an Mp-a distribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with intermediate mass Mp=10-100 Mearth and a .lt. 3 AU and with large mass Mp .gt. 103 Mearth and a .lt. 0.2 AU. Based on the simulated Mp-a distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity dependence of the fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with current radial velocity surveys. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as contained in their host stars, the detection probability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because protoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to their depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observations. This correlation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario. We also suggest other metallicity dependences of the planet distributions that can be tested by ongoing observations.},

  shorttitle = {Stacked {{Bayesian}} General {{Lomb}}-{{Scargle}} Periodogram},
  abstract = {Context. Distinguishing between a signal induced by either stellar activity or a planet is currently the main challenge in radial velocity searches for low-mass exoplanets. Even when the presence of a transiting planet and hence its period are known, stellar activity can be the main barrier to measuring the correct amplitude of the radial velocity signal. Several tools are being used to help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data. Aims. We aim to present a new tool that can be used for the purpose of identifying periodicities caused by stellar activity, and show how it can be used to track the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detection over time. The tool is based on the principle that stellar activity signals are variable and incoherent. Methods. We calculate the Bayesian general Lomb-Scargle periodogram for subsets of data and by adding one extra data point we track what happens to the presence and significance of periodicities in the data. Publicly available datasets from HARPS and HARPS-N were used for this purpose. Additionally, we analysed a synthetic dataset that we created with SOAP2.0 to simulate pure stellar activity and a mixture of stellar activity and a planet. Results. We find that this tool can easily be used to identify unstable and incoherent signals, such as those introduced by stellar activity. The SNR of the detection grows approximately as the square root of the number of data points, in the case of a stable signal. This can then be used to make decisions on whether it is useful to keep observing a specific object. The tool is relatively fast and easy to use, and thus lends itself perfectly to a quick analysis of the data.},

  abstract = {Kepler-10b was the first rocky planet detected by the Kepler satellite 
and confirmed with radial velocity follow-up observations from
Keck-HIRES. The mass of the planet was measured with a precision of
around 30\%, which was insufficient to constrain models of its internal
structure and composition in detail. In addition to Kepler-10b, a second
planet transiting the same star with a period of 45 days was
statistically validated, but the radial velocities were only good enough
to set an upper limit of 20 M $\oplus$ for the mass of
Kepler-10c. To improve the precision on the mass for planet b, the
HARPS-N Collaboration decided to observe Kepler-10 intensively with the
HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma. In
total, 148 high-quality radial-velocity measurements were obtained over
two observing seasons. These new data allow us to improve the precision
of the mass determination for Kepler-10b to 15\%. With a mass of 3.33
$\pm$ 0.49 M $\oplus$ and an updated radius of
1.47\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.02\} R $\oplus$, Kepler-10b has a density of
5.8 $\pm$ 0.8 g cm-3, very close to the value
predicted by models with the same internal structure and composition as
the Earth. We were also able to determine a mass for the 45-day period
planet Kepler-10c, with an even better precision of 11\%. With a mass of
17.2 $\pm$ 1.9 M $\oplus$ and radius of
2.35\^\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.04\} R $\oplus$, Kepler-10c has a density of
7.1 $\pm$ 1.0 g cm-3. Kepler-10c appears to be the
first strong evidence of a class of more massive solid planets with
longer orbital periods.

The inferred companion minimum mass is M\_2 sin\{i\}=5.1+2.6-1.5 \{M\}\_Jup and the semimajor axis a=3.03 $\pm$ 0.05 AU. Only one full orbital revolution has been monitored yet, and the periastron passage could not be observed since the star was too low on the horizon. The eccentricity and velocity semiamplitude remain therefore quite uncertain and the orbital solution is preliminary. HD 142022 is a chromospherically inactive K0 dwarf, metal rich relative to the Sun, and is the primary component of a wide binary. HD 142022 b is thus a new
"planet in binary" candidate, and its high eccentricity might be due to secular interactions with the distant stellar companion.},

  title = {Maximum Entropy Detection of Planets around Active Stars},
  abstract = {(shortened for arXiv) We aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanet detection around active stars by optimizing the use of Doppler Imaging in radial velocity measurements. We propose a simple method to simultaneously extract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographic inversion technique derived from classical Doppler mapping. Based on the maximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set of orbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resulting Doppler map. We carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform a preliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual Doppler map of the very active star HR 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data set for various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit. Using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peak activity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radial velocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planet down to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocity scatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). One noticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation, in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radial velocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustly recovered. The present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbital parameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when more classical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. It is easily adaptable to most existing Doppler Imaging codes, paving the way towards a systematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.},

  volume = {1506},
  abstract = {We present an attempt to improve models of the Rossiter-McLaughlin 
effect by relaxing several restrictive assumptions. For our main model
of the Doppler anomaly, we consider the entire multiline stellar
spectrum rather than just a single line, use no assumptions about the
shape of the lines profiles, and allow arbitrary size ratio for the star
and its eclipser. However, we neglect the effect of macro-turbulence and
differential rotation. We construct our model as a power series in the
stellar rotation velocity, \$V$\backslash$sin i\$, giving a closed set of analytic
formulae for up to three terms, and assuming quadratic limb-darkening
law. We consider three major approaches of determining the Doppler
shift: cross-correlation with a predefined template, cross-correlation
with an out-of-transit stellar spectrum, and parametric modelling of the
spectrum. We reveal that the Doppler anomaly has an additional
first-order (in \$V$\backslash$sin i\$) correction term, while previous works
primarily deal with only a second-order correction. This new term may
appear either in the case of asymmetric spectral lines or for an
imperfect cross-correlation template, in which the lines have random
misplacements with respect to their positions in the actual stellar
spectrum. We apply our approach to the Doppler data of HD 189733, for
which we obtain an improved model of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with
two correction terms, and derive a reduced value for \$V$\backslash$sin i\$.},

  abstract = {We have observed four transits of the planet of HD 209458 using the STIS spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ). Summing the recorded counts over wavelength between 582 and 638 nm yields a photometric time series with 80 s time sampling and relative precision of about 1.1 \texttimes{} 10 -4 per sample. The folded light curve can be fitted within observational errors using a model consisting of an opaque circular planet transiting a limb-darkened stellar disk. In this way we estimate the planetary radius R p = 1.347 $\pm$ 0.060 R Jup , the orbital inclination i = 86 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] fdg 6 $\pm$ 0 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] fdg 14, the stellar radius R * = 1.146 $\pm$ 0.050 R $\Sun$ , and one parameter describing the stellar limb darkening. Our estimated radius is smaller than those from earlier studies but is consistent within measurement errors and also with theoretical estimates of the radii of irradiated Jupiter-like planets. Satellites or rings orbiting the planet would, if large enough, be apparent from distortions of the light curve or from irregularities in the transit timings. We find no evidence for either satellites or rings, with upper limits on satellite radius and mass of 1.2 R $\oplus$ and 3 M $\oplus$ , respectively. Opaque rings, if present, must be smaller than 1.8 planetary radii in radial extent. The high level of photometric precision attained in this experiment confirms the feasibility of photometric detection of Earth-sized planets circling Sun-like stars.},

  abstract = {The first discoveries of extrasolar planets demonstrated that nature produces a much greater diversity of planetary systems than astronomers had anticipated. In an attempt to explain these surprises, theorists have proposed numerous generalizations to the classical model of planet formation.  Recently, researchers have begun testing some of these theories by comparing the predicted distributions of planet periods, eccentricities, and masses to those of the observed population of extrasolar planets. Such comparisons are becoming increasingly powerful thanks to the increasing number of known planets, improving measurement precision, increasing temporal baselines, and improving capability to control for detection biases.  Here, we discuss some of the orbital properties of the extrasolar planet population based on a systematic analysis of radial velocity planets and discuss implications for the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

potential of the precise radial velocity (PRV) method to advance the
NASA goal to "search for planetary bodies and Earth-like planets in
orbit around other stars.: (U.S. National Space Policy, June 28, 2010).
PRVs complement other exoplanet detection methods, for example offering
a direct path to obtaining the bulk density and thus the structure and
composition of transiting exoplanets. Our analysis builds upon previous
community input, including the ExoPlanet Community Report chapter on
radial velocities in 2008, the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy, the
Penn State Precise Radial Velocities Workshop response to the Decadal
Survey in 2010, and the NSF Portfolio Review in 2012. The
radial-velocity detection of exoplanets is strongly endorsed by both the
Astro 2010 Decadal Survey "New Worlds, New Horizons" and the NSF
Portfolio Review, and the community has recommended robust investment in
PRVs. The demands on telescope time for the above mission support,
especially for systems of small planets, will exceed the number of
nights available using instruments now in operation by a factor of at
least several for TESS alone. Pushing down towards true Earth twins will
require more photons (i.e. larger telescopes), more stable spectrographs
than are currently available, better calibration, and better correction
for stellar jitter. We outline four hypothetical situations for PRV work
necessary to meet NASA mission exoplanet science objectives.},

  title = {Search for Periodicity in the Observational Data by Means of Artificial Neuron Networks},
  abstract = {The possibility of application of artificial neural networks is 
considered for two classical model problems of observational data
reduction: (i) the identification of periodic oscillations in noisy time
series and (ii) assessment of the frequency of this oscillation (on the
existing time series). On the inputs of the neural networks the values
of the time series are given, and on the output, respectively, we have
either an indicatior of the presence of signal (from 0 to 1), or the
assessment of its frequency. It is shown that the theoretical limit,
which a neural network can achieve in the training to solve such
problems, corresponds to the Bayesian theory of estimation and testing
of statistical hypotheses. Training of the neural network was carried
out with a help of means of open-source package FANN. The best results
were achieved using the algorithm Cascade2, which allows finding the
optimal number of network neurons (not just the weight of the connection
between them). In comparison with traditional methods based on the
periodogram, which require long calculations, the trained neural network
works almost instantly. Thus, artificial neural networks are very
promising for the processing of large data sets. However, the threshold
of signal detection so far failed to bring to Bayesian theoretical
limit. In addition, it is not yet possible to train the neural network
to analyze time-series with arbitrarily-uneven distribution of
observations. This indicates on a need for further investigations to
improve the efficiency of the method.},

The algorithm analyses all suspicious periodicities that can be revealed, including the ones that look like an alias or noise at a glance, but later may prove to be a real variation. After selection of the initial candidates, the algorithm performs a complete pass through all their possible combinations and computes the rigorous multifrequency statistical significance for each such frequency tuple. The largest combinations that still survived this thresholding procedure represent the outcome of the analysis. The parallel computing on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is implemented through CUDA and brings a significant performance increase. It is still possible to run FREDEC solely on CPU in the traditional single-threaded mode, when no suitable GPU device is available. To verify the practical applicability of our algorithm, we apply it to an artificial time series as well as to some real-life exoplanetary radial-velocity data. We demonstrate that FREDEC can successfully reveal several known exoplanets. Moreover, it detected a new \$9.8\$-day variation in the Lick data for the five-planet system of 55 Cnc. It might indicate the existence of a small sixth planet in the 3:2 commensurability with the planet 55 Cnc b, although this detection is model-dependent and still needs a detailed verification.},

We have obtained ground-based radial velocity observations from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and unambiguously confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-91b by simultaneously modeling the Kepler and radial velocity data. The star exhibits temporally correlated noise due to stellar granulation which we model as a Gaussian Process. We hypothesize that it is this noise component that led previous studies to suspect Kepler-91b to be a false positive. Our work confirms the conclusions presented by Lillo-Box et al. that Kepler-91b is a 0.73 $\pm$ 0.13 M Jup planet orbiting a red giant star.},

Long-term ground-based spectroscopic monitoring of the Ca II H\&K activity proxies has demonstrated the existence of varying types of stellar cycles, while complementary photometric studies have revealed luminosity variations both in phase and in antiphase with chromospheric activity. Beginning in the late 1970s, space-based observations greatly affected our understanding of stellar chromospheres, spurring a
complementary evolution in interpretation of the ground-based results. Excellent recent reviews of the results of these programs have appeared, so in this paper, I will summarize the results and review them in the broad context of the development of our present state of knowledge, current outstanding questions and pitfalls facing workers in the field today, and the lines of investigation likely to be fruitful in the next decade.},

  title = {Probabilistic {{Forecasting}} of the {{Masses}} and {{Radii}} of {{Other Worlds}}},
  abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present a forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 objects with well-constrained masses and radii. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for measurement error, model uncertainty and the intrinsic dispersion observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at \$(2.0$\backslash$pm0.7) M\_\{$\backslash$oplus\}\$, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

  abstract = {The fibre-fed echelle spectrograph of Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ELODIE, is presented. This instrument has been in operation since the end of 1993 on the 1.93 m telescope. ELODIE is designed as an updated version of the cross-correlation spectrometer CORAVEL, to perform very accurate radial velocity measurements such as needed in the search, by Doppler shift, for brown-dwarfs or giant planets orbiting around nearby stars. In one single exposure a spectrum at a resolution of 42000 ($\lambda$/\{DELTA\}$\lambda$) ranging from 3906A to 6811A is recorded on a
1024x1024 CCD. This performance is achieved by using a tan\texttheta=4
echelle grating and a combination of a prism and a grism as
cross-disperser. An automatic on-line data treatment reduces all the ELODIE echelle spectra and computes cross-correlation functions. The instrument design and the data reduction algorithms are described in this paper. The efficiency and accuracy of the instrument and its long term instrumental stability allow us to measure radial velocities with an accuracy better than 15m/s for stars up to 9th magnitude in less than 30 minutes exposure time. Observations of 16th magnitude stars are also possible to measure velocities at about 1km/s accuracy. For classic spectroscopic studies (S/N$>$100) 9th magnitude stars can be observed in one hour exposure time.},

  title = {A {{Goldilocks}} Principle for Modeling Radial Velocity Noise},
  abstract = {The doppler measurements of stars are diluted and distorted by stellar activity noise. Different choices of noise models and statistical methods have led to much controversy in the confirmation of exoplanet candidates obtained through analysing radial velocity data. To quantify the limitation of various models and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection criteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework. According to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as signal, leading to false positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are likely to interprete signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find that the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor threshold of 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We further propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modeling radial velocity noise to avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives. We propose that the noise model with RHK-dependent jitter is used in combination with the moving average model to detect planetary signals for M dwarfs. Our work may also shed light on the noise modeling for hotter stars, and provide a valid approach for finding similar principles in other disciplines.},

The new planet has a mean period of P e = 126.6 days (over the 12.6-year baseline of the RV observations), and a minimum mass of m e sin i e = 12.9 $\pm$ 1.7 M $\oplus$ . The detection of the new planet has been enabled by significant improvements to our RV data set for GJ 876. The data have been augmented by 36 new high-precision measurements taken over the past five years. In addition, the precision of all of the Doppler measurements have been significantly improved by the incorporation of a high signal-to-noise template spectrum for GJ 876 into the analysis pipeline. Implementation of the new template spectrum improves the internal rms errors for the velocity measurements taken during 1998-2005 from 4.1 m s \textendash{}1 to 2.5 m s \textendash{}1 . Self-consistent, N-body fits to the RV data set show that the four-planet system has an invariable plane with an inclination relative to the plane of the sky of i = 59 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] fdg 5.

In our best-fit coplanar model, the mass of the new component is m e = 14.6 $\pm$ 1.7 M $\oplus$ . Our best-fitting model places the new planet in a three-body resonance with the previously known giant planets (which have mean periods of P c = 30.4 and P b = 61.1 days).

A symmetrical Gaussian apodization function with unknown width and center can distinguish planetary signals from SA signals on the basis of the width of the apodization function. The general model for m apodized Keplerian signals also includes a linear regression term between RV and the stellar activity diagnostic In (R'hk), as well as an extra Gaussian noise term with unknown standard deviation. The model parameters are explored using a Bayesian fusion MCMC code. A differential version of the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram provides an additional way of distinguishing SA signals and helps guide the choice of new periods. Sample results are reported for a recent international RV blind challenge which included multiple state of the art simulated data sets supported by a variety of stellar activity diagnostics.},

  title = {Tidal {{Downsizing}} Model. {{II}}. {{Planet}}-Metallicity Correlations},
  abstract = {Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation, requires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas giant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling in the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around metal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide range of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these observations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation hypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis calculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations of the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and not even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the inner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star metallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these smaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around the Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low metallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals, whereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow contract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally, simulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity preference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known directly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.},

  abstract = {Context. Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity measurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Aims. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities, line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H\&K chromospheric activity measurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities and line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H\&K variability, and identify activity cycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8\% of old solar-type stars in the solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones), while 61+/-8\% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK $<$ -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period, low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to \textasciitilde{}25 m/s. Caution is therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity data using simultaneous measurements of Ca II H\&K flux and line shape parameters. (Abridged)},

Shifting the centroid does not necessarily introduce line asymmetries.
This is fundamentally different from other types of stellar jitter so
far identified, which do result from line asymmetries. Furthermore, only
a very small change in stellar radius, \texttildelow{}0.01 per cent, is
necessary to generate a gravitational redshift variation large enough to
mask or mimic an Earth-twin. We explore possible mechanisms for stellar
radius fluctuations in low-mass stars. Convective inhibition due to
varying magnetic field strengths and the Wilson depression of starspots
are both found to induce substantial gravitational redshift variations.
Finally, we investigate a possible method for monitoring/correcting this
newly identified potential source of jitter and comment on its impact

Other techniques being used to search for planetary signatures include accurate measurement of positional (astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing and pulsar timing, the latter resulting in the detection of the first planetary mass bodies beyond our solar system in 1992. The transit of a planet across the face of the host star provides significant physical diagnostics, and the first such detection was announced in 1999. Protoplanetary disks, which represent an important evolutionary stage for understanding planet formation, are being imaged from space. In contrast, direct imaging of extra-solar planets represents an enormous challenge. Long-term efforts are directed towards infrared space interferometry, the detection of Earth-mass planets, and measurement of their spectral characteristics. Theoretical atmospheric models provide predictions of planetary temperatures, radii, albedos, chemical condensates and spectral features as a function of mass, composition and distance from the host star. Efforts to characterize planets occupying the `habitable zone', in which liquid water may be present, and indicators of the presence of life are advancing quantitatively.},

  title = {Three {{Super}}-{{Earths Orbiting HD}} 7924},
  abstract = {We report the discovery of two super-Earth mass planets orbiting the nearby K0.5 dwarf HD 7924 which was previously known to host one small planet. The new companions have masses of 7.9 and 6.4 M\$\_$\backslash$oplus\$, and orbital periods of 15.3 and 24.5 days. We perform a joint analysis of high-precision radial velocity data from Keck/HIRES and the new Automated Planet Finder Telescope (APF) to robustly detect three total planets in the system. We refine the ephemeris of the previously known planet using five years of new Keck data and high-cadence observations over the last 1.3 years with the APF. With this new ephemeris, we show that a previous transit search for the inner-most planet would have covered 70\% of the predicted ingress or egress times. Photometric data collected over the last eight years using the Automated Photometric Telescope shows no evidence for transits of any of the planets, which would be detectable if the planets transit and their compositions are hydrogen-dominated. We detect a long-period signal that we interpret as the stellar magnetic activity cycle since it is strongly correlated with the Ca II H and K activity index. We also detect two additional short-period signals that we attribute to rotationally-modulated starspots and a one month alias. The high-cadence APF data help to distinguish between the true orbital periods and aliases caused by the window function of the Keck data. The planets orbiting HD 7924 are a local example of the compact, multi-planet systems that the Kepler Mission found in great abundance.},

  abstract = {We investigate the estimation of orbital parameters by least-$\chi$ 2 Keplerian fits to radial velocity (RV) data using synthetic data sets. We find that while the fitted period is fairly accurate, the best-fit eccentricity and M p sin i are systematically biased upward from the true values for low signal-to-noise ratio, K /$\sigma$ \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 3, and a moderate number of observations, N obs \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 60, leading to a suppression of the number of nearly circular orbits. Assuming intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters, we generate a large number of mock RV data sets and study the selection effect on the eccentricity distribution. We find that the overall detection efficiency only mildly decreases with eccentricity. This is because although high-eccentricity orbits are more difficult to sample, they also have larger RV amplitudes for fixed planet mass and orbital semimajor axis. Thus, the primary source of uncertainty in the eccentricity distribution comes from biases in Keplerian fits to detections with low-amplitude and/or small N obs , rather than from selection effects. Our results suggest that the abundance of low-eccentricity exoplanets may be underestimated in the current sample, and we urge caution in interpreting the eccentricity distributions of low-amplitude detections in future RV samples.},

  title = {Mitigating Stellar Signals in the Quest for Other {{Earths}}},
  abstract = {After having found hundreds of extra-solar planets, the radial-velocity (RV) technique starts to be limited by intrinsic stellar signals. Indeed, at the level of the best spectrographs, one starts to see the effects induced by stellar pressure waves, convection, surface activity coupled with stellar rotation, and magnetic cycles. The questions of how to extract and analyse the different stellar signals from RV data, and how to mitigate their contributions have been studied in detail. In addition, optimizing the observational strategy to look for planets can also help in mitigating short-term stellar signal effects. As a result, a few dozen of the lowest mass planets known so far have been discovered following the work performed in this thesis. Among these planets, we have discovered Alpha Centauri Bb, the lightest extra-solar planet detected so far with the RV technique, and the closest one to our Solar System.},

Over the past decade, the availability of new techniques has moved the focus of research from the detection to the characterization of exoplanets. Next-generation facilities will produce even more complementary data that will lead to a comprehensive view of exoplanet characteristics and, by comparison with theoretical models, to a better understanding of planet formation.},

The standard MOOG version has been developed on unix, linux and macintosh computers.

One of the chief assets of MOOG is its ability to do on-line graphics. The plotting commands are given within the FORTRAN code. MOOG uses the graphics package SM, chosen for its ease of implementation in FORTRAN codes. Plotting calls are concentrated in just a few routines, and it should be possible for users of other graphics packages to substitute other appropriate FORTRAN commands.},

  abstract = {High-precision radial velocity planet searches have surveyed over \textasciitilde{}2000 nearby stars and detected over \textasciitilde{}200 planets. While these same stars likely harbor many additional planets, they will become increasingly challenging to detect, as they tend to have relatively small masses and/or relatively long orbital periods. Therefore, observers are increasing the precision of their observations, continuing to monitor stars over decade timescales, and also preparing to survey thousands more stars. Given the considerable amounts of telescope time required for such observing programs, it is important to use the available resources as efficiently as possible. Previous studies have found that a wide range of predetermined scheduling algorithms results in planet searches with similar sensitivities. We have developed adaptive scheduling algorithms which have a solid basis in Bayesian inference and information theory and also are computationally feasible for modern planet searches. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of plausible planet searches to test the power of adaptive scheduling algorithms. Our simulations demonstrate that planet searches performed with adaptive scheduling algorithms can simultaneously detect more planets, detect less massive planets, and measure orbital parameters more accurately than comparable surveys using a non-adaptive scheduling algorithm. We expect that these techniques will be particularly valuable for the N2K radial velocity planet search for short-period planets as well as future astrometric planet searches with the Space Interferometry Mission, which aim to detect terrestrial-mass planets.},

  abstract = {Radial velocity (RV) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value of M T sin( i ) condition (i.e., give information about) not only the planet's true mass M T but also the value of sin( i ) for that system (where i is the orbital inclination angle). Thus, the value of sin( i ) for a system with any particular observed value of M T sin( i ) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e., the presumptive prior distribution. Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn depends on the intrinsic distribution of M T for the exoplanet population being studied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several "toy models" for the intrinsic distribution of M T , on which we have significant information from available RV data in some mass ranges but little or none in others. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for simple power-law distributions of M T , the median value of sin( i ) in an observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the 0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power law in the range between \textendash{}2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of indices, the 95\% confidence interval on M T varies from 1.0001-2.405 ($\alpha$ = \textendash{}2) to 1.13-94.34 ($\alpha$ = +2) times larger than M T sin( i ) due to sin( i ) uncertainty alone. More complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M T yield more complicated and somewhat unintuitive posterior sin( i ) distributions. In particular, if the M T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M c , the posterior sin( i ) distribution will depend on the ratio of M T sin( i ) to M c , often in a non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets, both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin( i ) factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and well-understood statistical properties. We argue that reports of M T sin( i ) determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding confidence bounds on M T at, say, the 95\% level based on an explicitly stated assumed form of the true M T distribution in order to reflect more accurately the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.},

  title = {Extrasolar Planets Detections and Statistics through Gravitational Microlensing},
  abstract = {Gravitational microlensing was proposed thirty years ago as a promising method to probe the existence and properties of compact objects in the Galaxy and its surroundings. The particularity and strength of the technique is based on the fact that the detection does not rely on the detection of the photon emission of the object itself, but on the way its mass affects the path of light of a background, almost aligned source. Detections thus include not only bright, but also dark objects. Today, the many successes of gravitational microlensing have largely exceeded the original promises. Microlensing contributed important results and breakthroughs in several astrophysical fields as it was used as a powerful tool to probe the Galactic structure (proper motions, extinction maps), to search for dark and compact massive objects in the halo and disk of the Milky Way, to probe the atmospheres of bulge red giant stars, to search for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs and to hunt for extrasolar planets. As an extrasolar planet detection method, microlensing nowadays stands in the top five of the successful observational techniques. Compared to other (complementary) detection methods, microlensing provides unique information on the population of exoplanets, because it allows the detection of very low-mass planets (down to the mass of the Earth) at large orbital distances from their star (0.5 to 10 AU). It is also the only technique that allows the discovery of planets at distances from Earth greater than a few kiloparsecs, up to the bulge of the Galaxy. Microlensing discoveries include the first ever detection of a cool super-Earth around an M-dwarf star, the detection of several cool Neptunes, Jupiters and super-Jupiters, as well as multi-planetary systems and brown dwarfs. So far, the least massive planet detected by microlensing has only three times the mass of the Earth and orbits a very low mass star at the edge of the brown dwarf regime. Several free-floating planetary-mass objects, including free-floating planets of about Jupiter's mass, were also detected trough microlensing. Detections and non-detections inform us on the abundance of planets as a function of planetary mass and orbital distance. Recent microlensing studies imply that low-mass planets, in particular super-Earths, are far more abundant than giant planets, and reveal that there are, on average, one or more bound planets per Milky Way star. Future microlensing surveys will dramatically increase the number of microlensing alerts, thus providing unprecedented constraints on the planetary mass function, down to the mass of the Earth.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of Spitzer/IRAC primary transit and secondary eclipse lightcurves measured for HD209458b, using Gaussian process models to marginalise over the intrapixel sensitivity variations in the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron channels and the ramp effect in the 5.8 micron and 8.0 micron channels. The main advantage of this approach is that we can account for a broad range of degeneracies between the planet signal and systematics without actually having to specify a deterministic functional form for the latter. Our results do not confirm a previous claim of water absorption in transmission. Instead, our results are more consistent with a featureless transmission spectrum, possibly due to a cloud deck obscuring molecular absorption bands. For the emission data, our values are not consistent with the thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere that was originally inferred from these data. Instead, we agree with another re-analysis of these same data, which concluded a non-inverted atmosphere provides a better fit. We find that a solar-abundance clear-atmosphere model without a thermal inversion underpredicts the measured emission in the 4.5 micron channel, which may suggest the atmosphere is depleted in carbon monoxide. An acceptable fit to the emission data can be achieved by assuming that the planet radiates as an isothermal blackbody with a temperature of \$1484$\backslash$pm 18\$ K.},

  title = {Radial Velocity Fitting Challenge. {{II}}. {{First}} Results of the Analysis of the Data Set},
  volume = {1609},
  abstract = {Radial-velocity (RV) signals induce RV variations an order of magnitude 
larger than the signal created by the orbit of Earth-twins, thus
preventing their detection. The goal of this paper is to compare the
efficiency of the different methods used to deal with stellar signals to
recover extremely low-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV
variations at the m/s precision level or below is a combination of
signals induced by unresolved orbiting planets, by the star, and by the
instrument, performing such a comparison using real data is extremely
challenging. To circumvent this problem, we generated simulated RV
measurements including realistic stellar and planetary signals.
Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV measurements, using
their own method to recover planetary signals despite stellar RV
signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams with
the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,
it is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different
methods. The most efficient methods to recover planetary signals \{take
into account the different activity indicators,\} use red-noise models to
account for stellar RV signals and a Bayesian framework to provide model
comparison in a robust statistical approach. Using the most efficient
methodology, planets can be found down to K/N= K\_pl/RV\_rms*sqrt\{N\_obs\}=5
with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the level of 80-90\% recovery rate found
for a number of methods. These recovery rates drop dramatically for K/N
smaller than this threshold. In addition, for the best teams, no false
positives with K/N $>$ 7.5 were detected, while a non-negligible
fraction of them appear for smaller K/N. A limit of K/N = 7.5 seems
therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals
for RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV
fitting challenge systems.},

I review the surprising properties of extrasolar planetary systems and discuss how they are reshaping theories of planet formation. I focus on how multiple planet systems constrain the mechanisms proposed to explain the large eccentricities typical of extrasolar planets.  I suggest that strong planet-planet scattering is common and most planetary systems underwent a phase of large eccentricities.

I propose that a planetary system's final eccentricities may be strongly influenced by how much mass remains in a planetesimal disk after the last strong planet-planet scattering event.},

We find from this data that the dimensionless orbital separations have an approximately log-normal distribution. The paucity of small orbital separations implies that the population of planets does not increase monotonically as planet mass decreases. Using Hill's criterion for the dynamical stability of two planets, we find an upper bound on planet masses such that the most common planet mass does not exceed \$10\^\{-3.2\}m\_*\$, or about two-thirds Jupiter mass for solar mass stars. We generalized Hill's criterion in a statistical way to estimate the planet mass distribution function from the distribution of orbital separations. We suggest that the planet mass function is peaked in logarithm of mass, and we estimate that the most probable value of \$$\backslash$log m/M\_$\backslash$oplus\$ is \$$\backslash$sim(0.64-0.72)\$.},

was recently called into question by the detection of a periodic
photometric signal with the same period as the one observed in radial
velocity. In this paper, we investigate this possibility, using a
combination of radial-velocity, photometry, and bisector measurements
obtained simultaneously. The results show that while the observed
radial-velocity variation is always very stable in phase, period, and
amplitude, the photometric signal changes with time. The combined
information strongly suggests that the observed radial-velocity
variation is being produced by the presence of a planet, as firstly
proposed. The photometric variations are either not connected to the
planetary companion, or can eventually be induced by the interaction
between the planet and the star. Finally, the radial-velocity data
further show the presence of a long term trend, whose origin, still not
clear, might be related to the presence of another companion to the
system.

The new radial velocity (RV) measurements were obtained using a new data analysis technique that derives the Doppler measurement and other instrumental effects using a least-squares approach. Combining these new 143 measurements with 41 additional RVs from the Magellan/Planet Finder Spectrograph and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectrometers reveals three additional signals beyond the previously reported 7.2 day candidate, with periods of 28 days, 75 days, and a secular trend consistent with the presence of a gas giant (period 10 years). The 28 day signal implies a planet candidate with a minimum mass of 4.5 M $\oplus$ orbiting well within the canonical definition of the star's liquid water habitable zone (HZ), that is, the region around the star at which an Earth-like planet could sustain liquid water on its surface. Still, the ultimate water supporting capability of this candidate depends on properties that are unknown such as its albedo, atmospheric composition, and interior dynamics. The 75 day signal is less certain, being significantly affected by aliasing interactions among a potential 91 day signal, and the likely rotation period of the star at 105 days detected in two activity indices. GJ 667C is the common proper motion companion to the GJ 667AB binary, which is metal-poor compared to the Sun. The presence of a super-Earth in the HZ of a metal-poor M dwarf in a triple star system supports the evidence that such worlds should be ubiquitous in the Galaxy.},

detecting extrasolar planets and deriving mass detection limits that are
useful for constraining planet pulsations and formation models. 
Aims: Detection limit methods must take into account the temporal
distribution of power of various origins in the stellar signal. These
methods must also be able to be applied to large samples of stellar RV
time series Methods: We describe new methods for providing
detection limits. We compute the detection limits for a sample of ten
main-sequence stars, which are of G-F-A type, in general active, and/or
with detected planets and various properties. We use them to compare the
performances of these methods with those of two other methods used in
the litterature. Results: We obtained detection limits in the
2-1000 day period range for ten stars. Two of the proposed methods,
based on the correlation between periodograms and the power in the
periodogram of the RV time series in specific period ranges, are robust
and represent a significant improvement compared to a method based on
the root mean square of the RV signal. Conclusions: We conclude
that two of the new methods (correlation-based method and local power
analysis, i.e. LPA, method) provide robust detection limits, which are
better than those provided by methods that do not take into account the
temporal sampling.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of an Earth-sized planet (1.16 $\pm$ 0.19 R $\oplus$ ) in an 8.5 hr orbit around a late G-type star (KIC 8435766, Kepler-xx). The object was identified in a search for short-period planets in the Kepler database and confirmed to be a transiting planet (as opposed to an eclipsing stellar system) through the absence of ellipsoidal light variations or substantial radial-velocity variations. The unusually short orbital period and the relative brightness of the host star ( m Kep = 11.5) enable robust detections of the changing illumination of the visible hemisphere of the planet, as well as the occultations of the planet by the star. We interpret these signals as representing a combination of reflected and reprocessed light, with the highest planet dayside temperature in the range of 2300 K-3100 K. Follow-up spectroscopy combined with finer sampling photometric observations will further pin down the system parameters and may even yield the mass of the planet.},

  abstract = {A transiting extrasolar planet sequentially blocks off the light coming 
from the different parts of the disk of the host star in a
time-dependent manner. Because of the spin of the star, this produces an
asymmetric distortion in the line profiles of the stellar spectrum,
leading to an apparent anomaly in the the radial velocity curves, known
as the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Here, we derive approximate but
accurate analytic formulae for the anomaly in the radial velocity
curves, taking into account the stellar limb darkening. The formulae are
particularly useful in extracting information on the projected angle
between the planetary orbit axis and the stellar spin axis, $\lambda$,
and the projected stellar spin velocity, VsinIs. We create
mock samples for the radial curves for the transiting extrasolar system
HD 209458 and demonstrate that constraints on the spin parameters
(VsinIs, $\lambda$) can be significantly improved by combining
our analytic template formulae and the precision velocity curves from
high-resolution spectroscopic observations with 8-10 m class telescopes.
Thus, future observational exploration of transiting systems using the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect will be one of the most important probes for
a better understanding of the origin of extrasolar planetary systems,
especially the origin of their angular momentum.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201425298},
  abstract = {Context. The detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a 
difficult technical challenge at optical wavelengths. Even though this
signal is expected to replicate the stellar signal, not only is it
several orders of magnitude fainter, but it is also hidden among the
stellar noise. Aims: We apply a variant of the cross-correlation
technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the reflected signal
from planet 51 Peg b. Methods: Our method
makes use of the cross-correlation function (CCF) of a binary mask with
high-resolution spectra to amplify the minute planetary signal that is
present in the spectra by a factor proportional to the number of
spectral lines when performing the cross correlation. The resulting
cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a stellar template to
remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of the resulting
normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal further.
The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary properties,
including its real mass and albedo. Results: We detect evidence
for the reflected signal from planet 51 Peg b at a
significance of 3sigmanoise. The detection of the signal
permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46+0.06-0.01
MJup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04 MSun) for
the planet and an orbital inclination of 80+10-19
degrees. The analysis of the data also allows us to infer a tentative
value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of the planet. The
results suggest that 51Peg b may be an inflated hot
Jupiter with a high albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of
1.9 $\pm$ 0.3 RJup for a signal amplitude of 6.0 $\pm$
0.4 \texttimes{} 10-5). Conclusions: We confirm that the
method we perfected can be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected
signal, even with current observing facilities. The advent of next
generation of instruments (e.g. VLT-ESO/ESPRESSO) and observing
facilities (e.g. a new generation of ELT telescopes) will yield new
opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper into exoplanets
and their atmospheres.

Most of these are gravitationally bound to their host stars. There is some evidence of free-floating planetary-mass objects in young star-forming regions, but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (nature10092-m1jpg9505021) as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations towards the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However, a comparison with constraints from direct imaging suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about one Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits.},

  abstract = {Doppler planet searches revealed that many giant planets orbit close to their host star or in highly eccentric orbits. These and subsequent observations inspired new theories of planet formation that invoke gravitation interactions in multiple planet systems to explain the excitation of orbital eccentricities and even short-period giant planets. Recently, NASA's Kepler mission has identified over 300 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates, including many potentially rocky planets. Most of these systems include multiple planets with closely spaced orbits and sizes between that of Earth and Neptune. These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of planetary systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to explain the properties of giant exoplanets. Presently, we have limited knowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their sizes and orbital periods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler, the method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique for characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations for hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise, but complex, constraints on planetary masses, densities, and orbits, even for planetary systems with faint host stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations into increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution of planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler surveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns, and microlensing surveys, astronomers can look forward to a much better understanding of planet formation in the coming decade.},

  abstract = {Aims:It is known that stellar activity may complicate the analysis of 
high-precision radial-velocity spectroscopic data when looking for
exoplanets signatures. We aim at quantifying the impact of stellar spots
on stars with various spectral types and rotational velocities and
comparing the simulations with data obtained with the HARPS
spectrograph. Methods: We have developed detailed simulations of
stellar spots and estimated their effects on a number of observables
commonly used in the analysis of radial-velocity data when looking for
extrasolar planets, such as radial-velocity curves, cross-correlation
functions, bisector velocity spans, and photometric curves. Stellar and
spot properties are taken into account, as well as the characteristics
of the spectrograph used (generally HARPS). The computed stellar spectra
are then analyzed in the same way as when searching for exoplanets. Results: 1) A first grid of simulation results (radial-velocity
amplitudes, bisector velocity-span amplitudes and shapes, and
photometry) is built for F-K type stars, with different stellar and spot
properties. 2) It is shown quantitatively that star spots with typical
sizes of 1\% can mimic both radial-velocity curves and the bisector
behavior of short-period giant planets around G-K type stars with a v
sin\{i\} lower than the spectrograph resolution. For stars with
intermediate v sin\{i\}, smaller spots may produce similar features. Such
spots may complicate the search for low-mass planets on short-period
orbits. In these cases, additional observables (e.g., photometry,
spectroscopic diagnostics) are mandatory to confirm the presence of
short-period planets. We discuss these possibilities and show that, in
some cases, photometric variations may not be enough to clearly rule out
spots as explanations of the observed radial-velocity variations. This
is particularly important when searching for super-Earth planets. 3) It
is also stressed that quantitative values obtained for radial-velocity
and bisector velocity-span amplitudes depend strongly on the detailed
star properties, on the spectrograph used, on the line or set of lines
used, and on the way they are measured. High-resolution spectrographs
will help in distinguishing between spots and planets.

  abstract = {Aims: Extra-solar planet search programs require high-precision velocity measurements. They need to determine how to differentiate between radial-velocity variations due to Doppler motion and the noise induced by stellar activity. Methods: We monitored the active K2V star HD 189 733 and its transiting planetary companion, which has a 2.2-day orbital period. We used the high-resolution spectograph SOPHIE mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to obtain 55 spectra of HD 189 733 over nearly two months. We refined the HD 189 733b orbit parameters and placed limits on both the eccentricity and long-term velocity gradient. After subtracting the orbital motion of the planet, we compared the variability in spectroscopic activity indices with the evolution in the radial-velocity residuals and the shape of spectral lines. Results: The radial velocity, the spectral-line profile, and the activity indices measured in He I (5875.62 {\AA}),
H$\alpha$ (6562.81 {\AA}), and both of the Ca II H\&K lines (3968.47
{\AA} and 3933.66 {\AA}, respectively) exhibit a periodicity close
to the stellar-rotation period and the correlations between them are consistent with a spotted stellar surface in rotation. We used these correlations to correct for the radial-velocity jitter due to stellar activity. This results in achieving high precision in measuring the orbital parameters, with a semi-amplitude K = 200.56 $\pm$ 0.88 m
s-1 and a derived planet mass of MP = 1.13 $\pm$ 0.03 M\_Jup.

The second problem is finding the most favourable time for distinguishing alternative orbital fits (the scheduling of discriminating observations).
These methods of optimal planning are demonstrated to be potentially efficient for multiplanet extrasolar systems, in particular for resonant ones. In these cases, the optimal dates of observations are often concentrated in quite narrow time segments.},

Aims.The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained.
Methods.The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained.
Results.The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out.
Conclusions.The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

  abstract = {Aims: Stellar activity is a potentially important limitation to 
the detection of low-mass extrasolar planets with indirect methods
(radial velocity, photometry, astrometry). In previous papers, using the
Sun as a proxy, we investigated the impact of stellar activity (spots,
plages, convection) on the detectability of an Earth-mass planet in the
habitable zone (HZ) of solar-type stars with radial velocity techniques.
We here extend the detectability study to astrometry. Methods: We
used the sunspot and plages properties recorded over one solar cycle to
infer the astrometric variations that a Sun-like star seen edge-on, 10
pc away, would exhibit, if covered by such spots/bright structures. We
compare the signal to the one expected from the astrometric wobble (0.3
muas) of such a star surrounded by a one Earth-mass planet in the HZ.
We also briefly investigate higher levels of activity. Results:
The activity-induced astrometric signal along the equatorial plane has
an amplitude of typically less than 0.2 muas (rms = 0.07 muas),
lower than the one expected from an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU. Hence,
for this level of activity, the detectability is governed by the
instrumental precision rather than the activity. We show that for
instance a one Earth-mass planet at 1 AU would be detected with a
monthly visit during less than five years and an instrumental precision
of 0.8 muas. A level of activity five times higher would still allow
this detection with a precision of 0.35 muas. We conclude that
astrometry is an attractive approach to search for such planets around
solar type stars with most levels of stellar activity.},

  abstract = {The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015 the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path challenges for reaching 10 cm s -1 measurement precision. The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this bold precision are summarized here. Beginning with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity (RV) measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to improve upon the state of the art, producing even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision RV community include distinguishing center of mass (COM) Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities (time correlated noise) and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. COM velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. However, higher precision RV measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds, to confirm and characterize detections from transit missions, and to provide mass measurements for other space-based missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

  abstract = {As part of a national scientific network 'Pathways to Habitability' the formation of planets and the delivery of water onto these planets is a key question as water is essential for the development of life. In the first part of the paper we summarize the state of the art of planet formation - which is still under debate in the astronomical community - before we show our results on this topic. The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the choice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after gas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk. We also take into account that some of these planetesimals of sizes in the order of the mass of the Moon already contained water; the quantity depends on the distance from the Sun - close-by bodies are dry, but starting from a distance of about 2 AU they can contain substantial amounts of water. We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial planets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies containing water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets. We thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the actual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on the surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the formation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends on parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials involved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) simulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with respect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content before and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for extrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far).},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201321174},
  abstract = {Context. Exoplanet Doppler surveys are currently the most efficient 
means to detect low-mass companions to nearby stars. Among these stars,
the light M dwarfs provide the highest sensitivity to detect low-mass
exoplanet candidates. Evidence is accumulating that a substantial
fraction of these low-mass planets are found in high-multiplicity
planetary systems. GJ 163 is a nearby inactive M dwarf with abundant
public observations obtained using the HARPS spectrograph. Aims:
We obtain and analyse radial velocities from the HARPS public spectra of
GJ 163 and investigate the presence of a planetary companions orbiting
it. The number of planet candidates detected might depend on some prior
assumptions. Since the impact of prior choice has not been investigated
throughly previously, we study the effects of different prior densities
on the detectability of planet candidates around GJ 163. Methods:
We use Bayesian tools, i.e. posterior samplings and model comparisons,
when analysing the GJ 163 velocities. We consider models accounting for
the possible correlations of subsequent measurements. We also search for
activity-related counterparts of the signals we observe and test the
dynamical stability of the planetary systems corresponding to our
solutions using direct numerical integrations of the orbits. 
Results: We find that there are at least three planet candidates
orbiting GJ 163. The existence of a fourth planet is supported by the
data but the evidence in favor of the corresponding model is not yet
conclusive. The second innermost planet candidate in the system with an
orbital period of 25.6 days and a minimum mass of 8.7
M$\oplus$ is inside the liquid-water habitable zone of the
star. Conclusions: The architecture of GJ 163 system resembles a
scaled-down Solar System in the sense that there are two low-mass
planets on orbital periods of 8.7 and 25.6 days in the inner system, a
possible slightly more massive companion on an intermediate orbit, and
an outer sub-Saturnian companion at roughly 1 AU. The discovery of (yet)
another planetary system with several low-mass companions around a
nearby M-dwarf indicates that the high-multiplicity planetary systems
found by the NASA Kepler mission around G and K dwarfs is also present
(possibly even reinforced) around low-mass stars.

  abstract = {High-precision radial-velocity observations of the solar-type star 16 Cygni B (HR 7504, HD 186427), taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined McDonald and Lick data gives a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude (K) of 43.9 m s-1, and an eccentricity of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 M$\odot$, the mass function then implies a mass for the companion of 1.5/sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital
eccentricity cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal manner with a low-eccentricity orbit and has undergone postformational orbital evolution, either through the same process that has been proposed to have formed the ``massive eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD 114762, or by gravitational
interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf formed through fragmentation of the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar photospheric Li depletion, pre-mainsequence stellar rotation, the presence of a massive protoplanetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion.},

  abstract = {Only 3\textendash{}6 years ago, the Doppler technique was believed to have reached its final limitations in measuring stellar velocities and finding extra-solar planets. The 3\textendash{}4 m s -1 precision level achieved, at that time, by various teams, was certainly limited by instrumental performances, but also constrained, as believed by a part of the community, by intrinsic stellar limitations. The advent of HARPS drastically changed this view. The instrument demonstrated, through its recent discoveries, that stars more 'stable' than 1 m s -1 actually exist, and that their radial velocity (RV) can be measured at that level of precision. Short-term precision of 20 cm s -1 rms and long-term precision of the order of 30\textendash{}60 cm s -1 rms have been actually achieved on real stars, showing that RVs still harbor a great potential, and not only in the domain of extra-solar planets. Indeed, HARPS inspired the CODEX@ELT experiment for the direct determination of the expansion of the Universe, measuring the Doppler shift of Ly-$\alpha$ forest lines as a function of time. This experiment calls for a Doppler precision as low as 1 cm s -1 , which in turn inspires new possibilities in the domain of extra-solar planets. We will investigate the obstacles on the way to cm s -1 precision. The discussion presented here will be based on our experience with HARPS and what we consider to be the current limitations set by the instrument, telescope, atmosphere and star. Finally, we will also provide an outlook on possible improvements and expected performances, which will finally define new scientific opportunities.},

Terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of stars\textemdash{}where planetary surface conditions are compatible with the presence of liquid water\textemdash{}are of enormous interest because they might have global environments similar to Earth's and even harbour life. The light scattered by such a planet will vary in intensity and colour as the planet rotates; the resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's surface and atmospheric properties. Here we report a model that predicts features that should be discernible in the light curve obtained by low-precision photometry. For extrasolar planets similar to Earth, we expect daily flux variations of up to hundreds of per cent, depending sensitively on ice and cloud cover as well as seasonal variations. This suggests that the meteorological variability, composition of the surface (for example, ocean versus land fraction) and rotation period of an Earth-like planet could be derived from photometric observations. Even signatures of Earth-like plant life could be constrained or possibly, with further study, even uniquely determined.},

The hosts of shorter-period super-Earths are on average more metal-rich than those of longer-period super-Earths.

It is effective at solving complex problems including many where the posterior distribution is multimodal or has strong dependencies between variables.

  abstract = {Accurate and repeated photometric follow-up observations of planetary-transit events are important to precisely characterize the physical properties of exoplanets. A good knowledge of the main characteristics of the exoplanets is fundamental to trace their origin and evolution. Multi-band photometric observations play an important role in this process. By using new photometric data, we computed precise estimates of the physical properties of two transiting planetary systems. We present new broad-band, multi-colour, photometric observations obtained using three small class telescopes and the telescope-defocussing technique. For each of the two targets, one transit event was simultaneously observed through four optical filters. One transit of WASP-48 b was monitored with two telescopes from the same observatory. The physical parameters of the systems were obtained by fitting the transit light curves with \{$\backslash$sc jktebop\} and from published spectroscopic measurements. We have revised the physical parameters of the two planetary systems, finding a smaller radius for both HAT-P-23 b and WASP-48 b, \$R\_\{b\}=1.224 $\backslash$pm 0.037 R\_\{Jup\}\$ and \$R\_\{b\}=1.396 $\backslash$pm 0.051 $\backslash$, R\_\{Jup\}\$, respectively, than those measured in the discovery papers (\$R\_\{b\}=1.368 $\backslash$pm 0.090 R\_\{Jup\}\$ and \$R\_\{b\}=1.67 $\backslash$pm 0.10 R\_\{Jup\}\$). The density of the two planets are higher than those previously published (\$$\backslash$rho\_\{b\}\$ \textasciitilde{}1.1 and \textasciitilde{}0.3 \$$\backslash$rho\_\{jup\}\$ for HAT-P-23 and WASP-48 respectively) hence the two Hot Jupiters are no longer located in a parameter space region of highly inflated planets. An analysis of the variation of the planet's measured radius as a function of optical wavelength reveals flat transmission spectra within the experimental uncertainties. We also confirm the presence of the eclipsing contact binary NSVS-3071474 in the same field of view of WASP-48, for which we refine the value of the period to be 0.459 d.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging has only begun to inventory the population of gas giant 
planets on wide orbits around young stars in the solar neighborhood.
Following this approach, we carried out a deep imaging survey in the
near-infrared using VLT/NaCo to search for substellar companions. Here
we report the discovery of a probable companion orbiting the young
(10-17 Myr), dusty, early-type (A8) star HD 95086 at 56 AU in L' (3.8
$\mu$m) images. This discovery is based on observations with more than a
year time lapse. Our first epoch clearly revealed the source at \textasciitilde=
10$\sigma$, while our second epoch lacks good observing conditions,
yielding a \textasciitilde= 3$\sigma$ detection. Various tests were thus made to rule
out possible artifacts. This recovery is consistent with the signal at
the first epoch but requires cleaner confirmation. Nevertheless, our
astrometric precision suggests that the companion is comoving with the
star with a 3$\sigma$ confidence level. The planetary nature of the
source is reinforced by a non-detection in the Ks-band (2.18 $\mu$m)
images according to its possible extremely red Ks-L' color. Conversely,
background contamination is rejected with good confidence level. The
luminosity yields a predicted mass of about 4-5 M Jup (at
10-17 Myr) using "hot-start" evolutionary models, making HD 95086 b the
exoplanet with the lowest mass ever imaged around a star.

Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile, under program

  abstract = {This review is devoted to the problem of searching for periodicities in 
observational data using periodograms based on the general statistical
likelihood ratio test and special variants of it, including the
classical Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Primary emphasis is on the problem
of estimating the statistical significance of the periodicities detected
in this manner. We assume that a universal solution of this problem
exists involving an effective method in which the periodogram is
regarded as a random process (or random field), while an approximation
for the required "false alarm probability" is constructed by a
generalized Rice method. Besides a unified method for determining the
expected noise levels (or significance levels) of these periodograms, we
also examine some important special cases with different models of
periodic signals (linear and nonlinear). The false alarm probability
associated with an observed signal is approximated in most cases by a
formula of the type , where z is the observed maximum readout in the
periodogram and P is an algebraic polynomial with coefficients that
depend on the conditions of the problem. We also examine the problem of
separating composite signals with several frequencies from noise. In
this case correct analysis of the data requires the use of so-called
multifrequency periodograms based on models of signals containing
several periodic components. We show that a complete solution to this
problem requires construction of 2n-1 such periodograms,
where n is the total number of possible frequencies. Finally, we
describe some program packages that we have developed which make it
easier to perform practical frequency analysis of series using this
theory.},

With the existence of hundreds of exoplanets around single stars named by this convention and a handful of exoplanets around binary stars --
circumbinary planets -- it has become necessary to find a uniform and useful naming convention for the latter which is maximally compatible with the single host-star convention and which captures as much of the dynamical information about the planet as possible. We propose a simple and generic naming convention for all exoplanets which follows the provisional I.A.U. standard but more clearly indicates their dynamical status. The proposed convention is compatible with present usage and easily extendible to exoplanets around stars in systems of arbitrary multiplicity. We invite comments and discussion on the proposed
convention, in the hope of a timely adoption by the I.A.U. Commissions 5, 8+24, 26, 42, 45 and 53.},

Assuming Keplerian orbits, the two-companion model is found to be e48 times more probable than the one-planet model, although the orbital parameters of the second companion are only weakly constrained. The derived orbital periods are 345.6 $\pm$ 2.0 and 9017.8 $\pm$ 3180.7 d, respectively, and the

to the large uncertainty on the mass of the second companion, we are unable to determine whether it is a planet or a brown dwarf. The remaining 'noise' (stellar jitter) unaccounted for by the model is 2.28 $\pm$ 0.31 m s-1. We also analysed a three-companion

  abstract = {Starspots are created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars, just as sunspots. Their fields are strong enough to suppress the overturning convective motion and thus block or redirect the flow of energy from the stellar interior outwards to the surface and consequently appear as locally cool and therefore dark regions against an otherwise bright photosphere (Biermann in Astronomische Nachrichten 264:361, 1938; Z Astrophysik 25:135, 1948). As such, starspots are observable tracers of the yet unknown internal dynamo activity and allow a glimpse into the complex internal stellar magnetic field structure. Starspots also enable the precise measurement of stellar rotation which is among the key ingredients for the expected internal magnetic topology. But whether starspots are just blown-up sunspot analogs, we do not know yet. This article is an attempt to review our current knowledge of starspots. A comparison of a white-light image of the Sun (G2V, 5 Gyr) with a Doppler image of a young solar-like star (EK Draconis; G1.5V, age 100 Myr, rotation 10 \texttimes{} $\Omega$Sun) and with a mean-field dynamo simulation suggests that starspots can be of significantly different appearance and cannot be explained with a scaling of the solar model, even for a star of same mass and effective temperature. Starspots, their surface location and migration pattern, and their link with the stellar dynamo and its internal energy transport, may have far reaching impact also for our understanding of low-mass stellar evolution and formation. Emphasis is given in this review to their importance as activity tracers in particular in the light of more and more precise exoplanet detections around solar-like, and therefore likely spotted, host stars.},

  abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive, we describe a procedure ( BLENDER ) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64 +0.19 \textendash{}0.14 R $\oplus$ , and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass.},

  abstract = {Written by leading experts in the field, Stellar Spectral Classification is the only book to comprehensively discuss both the foundations and most up-to-date techniques of MK and other spectral classification systems. Definitive and encyclopedic, the book introduces the astrophysics of spectroscopy, reviews the entire field of stellar astronomy, and shows how the well-tested methods of spectral classification are a powerful discovery tool for graduate students and researchers working in astronomy and astrophysics. The book begins with a historical survey, followed by chapters discussing the entire range of stellar phenomena, from brown dwarfs to supernovae. The authors account for advances in the field, including the addition of the L and T dwarf classes; the revision of the carbon star, Wolf-Rayet, and white dwarf classification schemes; and the application of neural nets to spectral classification. Copious figures illustrate the morphology of stellar spectra, and the book incorporates recent discoveries from earth-based and satellite data. Many examples of spectra are given in the red, ultraviolet, and infrared regions, as well as in the traditional blue-violet optical region, all of which are useful for researchers identifying stellar and galactic spectra. This essential reference includes a glossary, handy appendixes and tables, an index, and a Web-based resource of spectra. In addition to the authors, the contributors are Adam J. Burgasser, Margaret M. Hanson, J. Davy Kirkpatrick, and Nolan R. Walborn},

Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition.

  shorttitle = {Intestinal {{pH}} and Propulsion},
  abstract = {Subjects deficient in lactase may experience bloating, cramps and diarrhoea after ingesting milk, due to the unhydrolysed and poorly-absorbed lactose. The diarrhoea may result from an osmotic effect of the lactose itself or its poorly-absorbed acidic products of fermentation (Weijers, van de Kamer \& others, 1961; Christopher \& Bayless, 1971), possibly together with an alteration of sodium and water absorption due to the lowered colonic pH (Rousseau \& Sladen, 1971). Laxation by lactulose (1-4-beta-galactosidofructose) may operate through an analogous mechanism. The drug is a synthetic dissaccharide which, in oral doses of 10-20 g, relieves chronic constipation (Wesselius-de Casparis, Braadbaart \& others, 1968). It is neither hydrolysed by intestinal dissaccharidase (Dahlqvist \& Gryboski, 1965) nor absorbed in the gut, but it is converted in the colon mainly to lactic and acetic acids by various bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus. Apart from the increased osmotic effect, the pH in the proximal colon falls markedly (Bown, Gibson \& others, 1974), and larger doses may reduce stool pH. Weijers \& others (1961) inferred that the acidic products formed from lactose in the colon stimulate propulsion, and K.S. Liem (Philips-Duphar) suggested to us that lactulose may relieve constipation partly by stimulation of propulsion due to the lowered pH. The experiments described below support this view.},

I propose that this search should be expanded to cool white dwarf stars that have expended their nuclear fuel. I define the continuously habitable zone of white dwarfs and show that it extends from \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] $\approx$ 0.005 to 0.02 AU for white dwarfs with masses from 0.4 to 0.9 M $\Sun$ , temperatures less than \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] $\approx$ 10 4 K, and habitable durations of at least 3 Gyr. As they are similar in size to Earth, white dwarfs may be deeply eclipsed by terrestrial planets that orbit edge-on, which can easily be detected with ground-based telescopes. If planets can migrate inward or reform near white dwarfs, I show that a global robotic telescope network could carry out a transit survey of nearby white dwarfs placing interesting constraints on the presence of habitable Earths. If planets were detected, I show that the survey would favor detection of planets similar to Earth: similar size, temperature, and rotation period, and host star temperatures similar to the Sun. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope could place even tighter constraints on the frequency of habitable Earths around white dwarfs. The confirmation and characterization of these planets might be carried out with large ground and space telescopes.},

These measurements provide a data set for exploring methods of identifying and ultimately distinguishing stellar photospheric velocities from Keplerian motion. We compare three methods we have used in exploring this data set: Dalmatian, an MCMC spot modeling code that fits photometric and RV measurements simultaneously; the FF${'}$ method, which uses photometric measurements to predict the stellar activity signal in simultaneous RV measurements; and H $\alpha$ analysis. We show that our H $\alpha$ measurements are strongly correlated with the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope ( MOST ) photometry, which led to a promising new method based solely on the spectroscopic observations. This new method, which we refer to as the HH${'}$ method, uses H $\alpha$ measurements as input into the FF${'}$ model. While the Dalmatian spot modeling analysis and the FF${'}$ method with MOST space-based photometry are currently more robust, the HH${'}$ method only makes use of one of the thousands of stellar lines in the visible spectrum. By leveraging additional spectral activity indicators, we believe the HH${'}$ method may prove quite useful in disentangling stellar signals.},

  abstract = {Aims: We explore the relations between physical and orbital 
properties of planets and properties of their host stars to identify the
main observable signatures of the formation and evolution processes of
planetary systems. Methods: We used a large sample of FGK dwarf
planet-hosting stars with stellar parameters derived in a homogeneous
way from the SWEET-Cat database to study the relation between stellar
metallicity and position of planets in the period-mass diagram. We then
used all the radial-velocity-detected planets orbiting FGK stars to
explore the role of planet-disk and planet-planet interaction on the
evolution of orbital properties of planets with masses above 1
MJup. Results: Using a large sample of FGK dwarf hosts
we show that planets orbiting metal-poor stars have longer periods than
those in metal-rich systems. This trend is valid for masses at least
from $\approx$10 M$\oplus$ to $\approx$4 MJup. Earth-like
planets orbiting metal-rich stars always show shorter periods (fewer
than 20 days) than those orbiting metal-poor stars. However, in the
short-period regime there are a similar number of planets orbiting
metal-poor stars. We also found statistically significant evidence that
very high mass giants (with a mass higher than 4 MJup) have
on average more eccentric orbits than giant planets with lower mass.
Finally, we show that the eccentricity of planets with masses higher
than 4 MJup tends to be lower for planets with shorter
periods. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the planets in the
P - MP diagram are evolving differently because of a
mechanism that operates over a wide range of planetary masses. This
mechanism is stronger or weaker, depending on the metallicity of the
respective system. One possibility is that planets in metal-poor disks
form farther out from their central star and/or they form later and do
not have time to migrate as far as the planets in metal-rich systems.
The trends and dependencies obtained for very high mass planetary
systems suggest that planet-disk interaction is a very important and
orbit-shaping mechanism for planets in the high-mass domain.},

  abstract = {We observed the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b (also known as HAT-P-32Ab) to determine its optical transmission spectrum by measuring the wavelength-dependent planet-to-star radius ratios in the region between 518 - 918 nm. We used the OSIRIS instrument at the GTC in long slit spectroscopy mode, placing HAT-P-32 and a reference star in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra covering two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were able to yield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm wide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve modeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and 972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a high altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a strong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary atmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric features. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a previous ground-based study of the optical spectrum of this planet. This agreement between independent results demonstrates that ground-based measurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible results despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic noise, as long as the noise source is well understood and properly corrected. We also extract an optical spectrum of the M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B. Using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models we determine an effective temperature of \$T\_$\backslash$mathrm\{eff\}= 3187\^\{+60\}\_\{-71\}\$ K, slightly colder than previous studies relying only on broadband infra-red data.},

  title = {Is the Activity Level of {{HD}} 80606 Influenced by Its Eccentric Planet?},
  abstract = {Aims: Several studies suggest that the activity level of a planet-host star can be influenced by the presence of a close-by orbiting planet. Moreover, the interaction mechanisms that have been proposed, magnetic interaction and tidal interaction, exhibit a very different dependence on orbital separation between the star and the planet. A detection of activity enhancement and characterization of its dependence on planetary orbital distance can, in principle, allow us to characterize the physical mechanism behind the activity enhancement. Methods: We used the HARPS-N spectrograph to measure the stellar activity level of HD 80606 during the planetary periastron passage and compared the activity measured to that close to apastron. Being characterized by an eccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme variation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our hypothesis. Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the star as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity indicators employed log(\$R'\_\{HK\}\$), H\$\_$\backslash$alpha\$, NaI, and HeI. None of the models employed, whether magnetic interaction or tidal interaction, provides a good description of the data. Conclusions: We find no evidence for star-planet interaction in HD$\backslash$,80606 at the moment of the periastron passage of its very eccentric planet. The straightforward explanation for the non-detection is the absence of interaction as a result of a low magnetic field strength on either the planet or the star and of the low level of tidal interaction between the two. However, we cannot exclude two scenarios: i) the interaction can be instantaneous and of magnetic origin, being concentrated on the substellar point and its surrounding area, and ii) the interaction can lead to a delayed activity enhancement.

  abstract = {We determine the true and the projected obliquity of HAT-P-36 and WASP-11/HAT-P-10 systems, respectively, which are both composed of a relatively cool star and a hot-Jupiter planet. Thanks to the high-resolution spectrograph HARPS-N, we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for both the systems by acquiring precise radial-velocity measurements during planetary transit events. We also present photometric observations comprising six light curves covering five transit events, obtained using three medium-class telescopes and the telescope-defocussing technique. One transit of WASP-11/HAT-P-10 was followed contemporaneously from two observatories. The three transit light curves of HAT-P-36b show anomalies attributable to starspot complexes on the surface of the parent star, in agreement with the analysis of its spectra that indicate a moderate activity. By analysing the complete HATNet data set of HAT-P-36, we estimated the stellar rotation period by detecting a periodic photometric modulation in the light curve caused by star spots, obtaining Prot=15.3 days, which implies that the inclination of the stellar rotational axis with respect to the line of sight is 65 degree. We used the new spectroscopic and photometric data to revise the main physical parameters and measure the sky-projected misalignment angle of the two systems. We found $\backslash$lambda=-14 degree for HAT-P-36 and $\backslash$lambda=7 degree for WASP-11/HAT-P-10, indicating in both cases a good spin-orbit alignment. In the case of HAT-P-36, we also measured its real obliquity, which resulted to be 25 degrees.},

  abstract = {Aims: We re-evaluate the correlation between planetary surface 
gravity and stellar host activity as measured by the index log
(R'HK). This correlation, previously identified by Hartman
(2010, ApJ, 717, L138), is now analyzed in light of an extended
measurement dataset, roughly three times larger than the original one.
 Methods: We calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient
between the two quantities and its associated p-value. The correlation
coefficient was calculated for both the full dataset and the star-planet
pairs that follow the conditions proposed by Hartman (2010). To do so,
we considered effective temperatures both as collected from the
literature and from the SWEET-Cat catalog, which provides a more
homogeneous and accurate effective temperature determination. 
Results: The analysis delivers significant correlation coefficients, but
with a lower value than those obtained by Hartman (2010). The two
datasets are compatible, and we show that a correlation coefficient as
high as previously published can arise naturally from a small-number
statistics analysis of the current dataset. The correlation is recovered
for star-planet pairs selected using the different conditions proposed
by Hartman (2010). Remarkably, the usage of SWEET-Cat temperatures led
to higher correlation coefficient values. We highlight and discuss the
role of the correlation betwen different parameters such as effective
temperature and activity index. Several additional effects on top of
those discussed previously were considered, but none fully explains the
detected correlation. In light of the complex issue discussed here, we
encourage the different follow-up teams to publish their activity index
values in the form of a log (R'HK) index so that a comparison
across stars and instruments can be pursued.

The throughput of the instrument (+40\% at 550 nm), its illumination uniformity and stability, and thus its radial velocity (RV) stability, are
significantly improved. An RV offset correlated with the width of the stellar lines is found with the new fibres from observations of RV standards. As a result of this major upgrade, and once the laser frequency comb that is already assembled in the HARPS room is fully functional, we expect to reach an RV precision better than 0.5 m s-1 on bright stars.},

  abstract = {Two years ago a new benchmark for the planetary survey was set with the discoveries of three extrasolar planets with masses below 20 M\_$\oplus$. In particular, the serendipitous discovery of the 14 M\_$\oplus$ planet
around $\mu$ Ara found with HARPS with a semi-amplitude of only 4 m
s-1 put in evidence the tremendous potential of HARPS for the search of this class of very low-mass planets. Aiming to discovering new worlds similar to $\mu$ Ara b, we carried out an intensive campaign with HARPS to observe a selected sample of northern stars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. Two stars in our program were found to present radial velocity variations compatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. The first of these, HD 219828, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8 M\_$\oplus$
and an orbital period of 3.83 days. It is the 11th Neptune-mass planet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. The radial velocity data clearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely of planetary mass. The second planet orbits HD 102195, has a mass of 0.45 M\_Jup and an orbital period of 4.11 days. This planet has been already announced by Ge et al. (2006, ApJ, 648, 683). Our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found by these authors. We also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution are caused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the HARPS cross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity. An improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. This kind of analysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellar activity induced noise.

Keck Observatory reveals evidence for a third planet orbiting the nearby (4.69 pc) dM4 star GJ 876. The residuals of three-body Newtonian fits, which include GJ 876 and Jupiter-mass companions b and c, show significant power at a periodicity of 1.9379 days. Self-consistently fitting the radial velocity data with a model that includes an additional body with this period significantly improves the quality of the fit. These four-body (three-planet) Newtonian fits find that the minimum mass of companion "d" is m sin i = 5.89 $\pm$ 0.54 M $\oplus$ and that its orbital period is 1.93776 ($\pm$7 \texttimes{} 10 -5 ) days. Assuming coplanar orbits, an inclination of the GJ 876 planetary system to the plane of the sky of 50$^\circ$ gives the best fit. This inclination yields a mass for companion d of m = 7.53 $\pm$ 0.70 M $\oplus$ , making it by far the lowest mass companion yet found around a main-sequence star other than our Sun. Precise photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory confirm low-level brightness variability in GJ 876 and provide the first explicit determination of the star's 96.7 day rotation period. Even higher precision short-term photometric measurements obtained at Las Campanas imply that planet d does not transit GJ 876.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a highly parallel Kepler equation solver using the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) on a commercial nVidia GeForce 280GTX and the ``Compute Unified Device Architecture'' (CUDA) programming environment. We apply this to evaluate a goodness-of-fit statistic (e.g., $\chi$ 2 ) for Doppler observations of stars potentially harboring multiple planetary companions (assuming negligible planet\textendash{}planet interactions). Given the high-dimensionality of the model parameter space (at least five dimensions per planet), a global search is extremely computationally demanding. We expect that the underlying Kepler solver and model evaluator will be combined with a wide variety of more sophisticated algorithms to provide efficient global search, parameter estimation, model comparison, and adaptive experimental design for radial velocity and/or astrometric planet searches.

We tested multiple implementations using single precision, double precision, pairs of single precision, and mixed precision arithmetic. We find that the vast majority of computations can be performed using single precision arithmetic, with selective use of compensated summation for increased precision. However, standard single precision is not adequate for calculating the mean anomaly from the time of observation and orbital period when evaluating the goodness-of-fit for real planetary systems and observational data sets. Using all double precision, our GPU code outperforms a similar code using a modern CPU by a factor of over 60. Using mixed precision, our GPU code provides a speed-up factor of over 600, when evaluating n sys \&gt; 1024 models planetary systems each containing n pl = 4 planets and assuming n obs = 256 observations of each system. We conclude that modern GPUs also offer a powerful tool for repeatedly evaluating Kepler's equation and a goodness-of-fit statistic for orbital models when presented with a large parameter space.},

  abstract = {Five and a half years of data from an extensive ROSAT X-ray monitoring program devoted to the young K-star AB Dor are presented. Begun in mid-1990, this program is aimed at the study of the long-term behaviour of coronal flux levels in this very active star. We compare the X-ray data with 17 years of V-band brightness monitoring that shows a 10-year decline between 1978 and 1989 and a subsequent rise phase. In contrast, the X-ray flux, which is very variable on time scales of minutes to weeks, exhibits no pronounced long-term trend over the 5 1/2-years of the program. This supports the concept of a saturated corona. Making use of the ROSAT all-sky survey data and data from the most extensive among the available pointed observations we also discuss the short-term variablity in relation to the rotational time scale. We find evidence for a partial rotational modulation of the X-ray flux implying structural inhomogeneities in this saturated corona.},

KOI-614b has a mass of \$2.86$\backslash$pm0.35\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{Jup\}\}\$ and a radius of \$1.13\^\{+0.26\}\_\{-0.18\}\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm R\_\{Jup\}\}\$, and it orbits a G0, metallic ([Fe/H]=\$0.35$\backslash$pm0.15\$) dwarf in 12.9 days. Its mass and radius are familiar and compatible with standard planetary evolution models, so it is one of the few known transiting planets in this mass range to have an orbital period over ten days. With an equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{eq\}=1000 $\backslash$pm 45\$ K, this places KOI-614b at the transition between what is usually referred to as "hot" and "warm" Jupiters. KOI-206b has a mass of \$2.82$\backslash$pm 0.52\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{Jup\}\}\$ and a radius of \$1.45$\backslash$pm0.16\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm R\_\{Jup\}\}\$, and it orbits a slightly evolved F7-type star in a 5.3-day orbit. It is a massive inflated hot Jupiter that is particularly challenging for planetary models because it requires unusually large amounts of additional dissipated energy in the planet. On the other hand, KOI-680b has a much lower mass of \$0.84$\backslash$pm0.15\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm M\_\{Jup\}\}\$ and requires less extra-dissipation to explain its uncommonly large radius of \$1.99$\backslash$pm0.18\textasciitilde\{$\backslash$rm R\_\{Jup\}\}\$. It is one of the biggest transiting planets characterized so far, and it orbits a subgiant F9-star well on its way to the red giant stage, with an orbital period of 8.6 days. With host stars of masses of \$1.46$\backslash$pm0.17\textasciitilde{}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$ and \$1.54 $\backslash$pm 0.09\textasciitilde{}M\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$, respectively, KOI-206b, and KOI-680b are interesting objects for theories of formation and survival of short-period planets around stars more massive than the Sun. For those two targets, we also find signs of a possible distant additional companion in the system.},

  shorttitle = {Scales of {{Evidence}} for {{Model Selection}}},
  abstract = {Model selection refers to a data-based choice among competing statistical models, for example choosing between a linear or a quadratic regression function. The most popular model selection techniques are based on interpretations of p-values, using a scale originally suggested by Fisher: .05 is moderate evidence against the smaller model, .01 is strong evidence, etc. Recent Bayesian literature, going back to work by Jeffreys, suggests a quite different answer to the model selection problem. Jeffreys provided an interpretive scale for Bayes factors, a scale which can be implemented in practice by use of the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion.) The Jeffreys scale often produces much more conservative results, especially in large samples, so for instance a .01 p-value may correspond to barely any evidence at all against the smaller model. This paper tries to reconcile the two theories by giving an interpretation of Fisher's scale in terms of Bayes factors. A general interpretation is given which works fine when checked for the one-dimensional Gaussian problem, where standard hypothesis testing is seen to coincide with a Bayesian analysis that assumes stronger (more informative) priors than those used by the BIC. This argument fails in higher dimensions, where Fisher's scale must be made more conservative in order to get a proper Bayes justification.},

PlanetPack is a command-line interpreter, that can run either in an interactive mode or in a batch mode of automatic script interpretation. Its major abilities include: (i) Advanced RV curve fitting with the proper maximum-likelihood treatment of unknown RV jitter; (ii) User-friendly multi-Keplerian as well as Newtonian \$N\$-body RV fits; (iii) Use of more efficient maximum-likelihood periodograms that involve the full multi-planet fitting (sometimes called as ``residual'' or ``recursive'' periodograms); (iv) Easily calculatable parametric 2D likelihood function level contours, reflecting the asymptotic confidence regions; (v) Fitting under some useful functional constraints is user-friendly; (vi) Basic tasks of short- and long-term planetary dynamical simulation using a fast Everhart-type integrator based on Gauss--Legendre spacings; (vii) Fitting the data with red noise (auto-correlated errors); (viii) Various analytical and numerical methods for the tasks of determining the statistical significance. It is planned that further functionality may be added to PlanetPack in the future. During the development of this software, a lot of effort was made to improve the calculational speed, especially for CPU-demanding tasks. PlanetPack was written in pure C++ (standard of 1998/2003), and is expected to be compilable and usable on a wide range of platforms.},

Our goal is to see whether the earlier studies discussing the system fell victims of false negative detections. We perform the analyses by using an independent statistical method based on posterior samplings and model comparisons in the Bayesian framework that is known to be more sensitive to weak signals of low-mass planets. According to our analyses, we find strong evidence in favour of a third candidate planet in the system corresponding to a cold sub-Saturnian planet with an orbital period of 500 d and a minimum mass of 29 M$\oplus$. Application of sub-optimal signal detection methods can leave low-amplitude signals undetected in radial velocity time series. Our results suggest that the estimated statistical
properties of low-mass planets can thus be biased because several signals corresponding to low-mass candidate planets may have gone unnoticed. This also suggests that the occurrence rates of such planets based on radial velocity surveys might be underestimated. L31},

The search includes a total of 198,709 stellar targets, of which 112,046 were observed in all 17 quarters and 86,663 in fewer than 17 quarters. We report on 17,230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that meets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed transit events, detection statistic (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) in excess of the search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting planet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search for additional planets adds 16,802 transit signals for a total of 34,032; this far exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs. There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final Kepler transit search. A comparison of the transit signals against a set of 3402 well-established, high-quality Kepler Objects of Interest yields a recovery rate of 99.8\%. The high recovery rate must be weighed against a large number of false-alarm detections. We examine characteristics of the planet population implied by the transiting planet model fits with an emphasis on detections that would represent small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of their host stars.},

  abstract = {What is the nature of what we commonly refer to as starspots? The answer to that question determines what we can learn from the study of starspots about stars, their internal dynamics, and their magnetic activity. Observations of the Sun, the only cool star that we can observe in detail, naturally led to the hypothesis that starspots in other cool stars are magneto-convective phenomena in which a magnetic field substantially affects the structure of a stellar atmosphere. Spectral line features, eclipse light curves, and intensity modulations are consistent with that hypothesis. Yet for almost all stars for which starspots are reported, the surface coverage is very much higher than for the Sun, while many stars manifest spots at high latitudes where the Sun has never been seen to do so. In this review, I address how well starspots compare to sunspots, discuss some differences expected when moving away from the Sun in the HR diagram or in level of activity, and identify resources to further deepen our understanding.},

their host stars with orbital periods that place them in mean motion
resonances (MMRs). These systems are generally in first-order resonances
and dynamical studies have focused their efforts on understanding the
origin and evolution of such dynamically resonant commensurabilities.
Here we report the discovery of two super-Earths that are close to a
second-order dynamical resonance orbiting the metal-poor ([Fe/H] =
-0.43 dex) and inactive G2V star HD 41428. We analyzed 62 HARPS
archival radial velocities for this star that, until now, exhibited no
evidence for planetary companions. Using our new Bayesian Doppler signal
detection algorithm, we find two significant signals in the data, with
periods of 18.357 days and 25.648 days, indicating they could be part of
a 7:5 second-order MMR. Both semi-amplitudes are below 3 m
s-1 and the minimum masses of the pair are 12.3 and 8.6
M $\oplus$, respectively. Our simulations found that apsidal
alignment stabilizes the system, and even though libration of the
resonant angles was not seen, the system is affected by the presence of
the resonance and could still occupy the 7:5 commensurability, which
would be the first planetary configuration in such a dynamical
resonance. Given the multitude of low-mass multi-planet systems that
will be discovered in the coming years, we expect that more of these
second-order resonant configurations will emerge from the data,
highlighting the need for a better understanding of the dynamical
interactions between forming planetesimals.},

Parallel chromospheric Ca II H and K emission data from the Mount Wilson Observatory span the entire interval. The extended data strengthen the relationship between chromospheric and brightness variability at visible wavelengths derived previously. We show that the full range of photometric variation has probably now been observed for a majority of the program stars. Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable according to an objective statistical criterion. On a year-to-year timescale, young active stars become fainter when their Ca II emission increases, while older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca II emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y stellar filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample.},

  abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive, we describe a procedure ( BLENDER ) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64 +0.19 \textendash{}0.14 R $\oplus$ , and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass.},

  abstract = {We present an inversion method based on Bayesian analysis to constrain the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets, in the form of chemical composition of the mantle and core size. Specifically, we identify what parts of the interior structure of terrestrial exoplanets can be determined from observations of mass, radius, and stellar elemental abundances. We perform a full probabilistic inverse analysis to formally account for observational and model uncertainties and obtain confidence regions of interior structure models. This enables us to characterize how model variability depends on data and associated uncertainties. We test our method on terrestrial solar system planets and find that our model predictions are consistent with independent estimates. Furthermore, we apply our method to synthetic exoplanets up to 10 Earth masses and up to 1.7 Earth radii as well as to exoplanet Kepler-36b. Importantly, the inversion strategy proposed here provides a framework for understanding the level of precision required to characterize the interior of exoplanets. Our main conclusions are: (1) observations of mass and radius are sufficient to constrain core size; (2) stellar elemental abundances (Fe, Si, Mg) are key constraints to reduce degeneracy in interior structure models and to constrain mantle composition; (3) the inherent degeneracy in determining interior structure from mass and radius observations does not only depend on measurement accuracies but also on the actual size and density of the exoplanet. We argue that precise observations of stellar elemental abundances are central in order to place constraints on planetary bulk composition and to reduce model degeneracy. [...]},

These data allow us to determine the mass and orbital parameters of the second companion completely (up to the usual unknown orbital inclination angle i 2 ). The current best-fit parameters correspond to a second companion of planetary mass, m 2 sin i 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] simeq 7 \texttimes{} 10 -3 M $\Sun$ , in an orbit of eccentricity e 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] simeq 0.45 and semimajor axis a 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] simeq 60 AU. Using numerical scattering experiments, we study a possible formation scenario for the triple system, which involves a dynamical exchange interaction between the binary pulsar and a primordial star-planet system. The current orbital parameters of the triple are consistent with such a dynamical origin and suggest that the separation of the parent star-planet system was very large, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] gtrsim 50 AU. We also examine the possible origin of the anomalously high eccentricity of the inner binary pulsar. While this eccentricity could have been induced during the same dynamical interaction that created the triple, we find that it could equally well arise from long-term secular perturbation effects in the triple, combining the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit with the Newtonian gravitational perturbation of the planet. The detection of a planet in this system may be taken as evidence that large numbers of extrasolar planetary systems, not unlike those discovered recently in the solar neighborhood, also exist in old star clusters.},

  abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R $\oplus$ . For each of the 156,000 target stars, we assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p , and orbital period, P , using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] sstarf / a . We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp $<$ 15 mag, i.e., bright, main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R $\oplus$ . We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R $\oplus$ ) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, 0.25 AU) in our study. For P $<$ 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df / d log R = k R R $\alpha$ with k R = 2.9 +0.5 \textendash{} 0.4 , $\alpha$ = \textendash{}1.92 $\pm$ 0.11, and R $\equiv$ R p / R $\oplus$ . This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p $>$ 2 R $\oplus$ we measure an occurrence of less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 $\pm$ 0.008, 0.023 $\pm$ 0.003, and 0.013 $\pm$ 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R $\oplus$ , in agreement with Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0 . For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R $\oplus$ planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff , with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).},

  abstract = {Estimating errors is a crucial part of any scientific analysis. Whenever a parameter is estimated (model-based or not), an error estimate is necessary. Any parameter estimate that is given without an error estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach such methods for error estimation to themselves when working scientifically for the first time. This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying \$$\backslash$chi\^2\$, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.},

C. Wilson. Most of the measurements began in 1966, with observations scheduled monthly until 1980, when observations were scheduled sevral times per week. The records, with a long-term precision of about 1.5\%, display fluctuations that can be identified with
variations on timescales similar to the 11 yr cycle of solar activity as well as axial rotation, and the growth and decay of emitting regions. We present the records of chromospheric emission and general conclusions about variations in surface magnetic activity on timescales greater than 1 yr but less than a few decades. The results for stars of spectral type G0-K5 V indicate a pattern of change in rotation and chromospheric activity on an evolutionary timescale, in which (1) young stars exhibit high average levels of activity, rapid rotation rates, no Maunder minimum phase and rarely display a smooth, cyclic variation; (2) stars of intermediate age (approximately 1-2 Gyr for 1 solar mass) have moderate levels of activity and rotation rates, and occasional smooth cycles; and (3) stars as old as the Sun and older have slower rotation rates, lower activity levels and smooth cycles with occasional Maunder minimum-phases.},

We newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of the stars in our study sample. The RV variations reported herein range from less than 4 to 135~m s\textendash{}1, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for chromospherically quiet stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find with high statistical significance that the RV rms manifests strongly in the Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the observed RV variations by factors of \textasciitilde{}2-1000, likely because the low-level photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler light curves, dominated by a single relatively high-amplitude component of variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV rms behavior of our sample can be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram introduced by Bastien et~al. We use this diagram to derive the surface gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off the main sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV rms are those that have evolved onto the flicker floor sequence in that diagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complex photometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.},

We transmit violet starlight through a Fabry-Perot etalon interferometer and sense changes in Doppler shift from changes in the fluxes of light on the slopes of stellar absorption lines. Our data now span 6 years. Our observations of the Sun showed earlier that both our technique and the profiles of solar photospheric violet absorption lines can be stable enough to reveal planetary perturbations. We now carry this validation to the spectra of other near-solar-type stars. Annual averages of our RV's of$\sigma$ Draconis and$\beta$ Virginis are stable to $\pm$6 m s-1. The slope of our five-year series of RV's of$\xi$ Bootis A is consistent with the star's well-determined visual astrometric orbit about$\xi$ Bootis B. The Fabry-Perot technique of Doppler shift measurement is fully capable of detecting perturbations due to planets with masses and orbits similar to those of Jupiter.},

demonstrate that for planets on high-eccentricity orbits the Keplerian
periodogram is far more efficient than the classic Lomb-Scargle
periodogram and even the multiharmonic periodograms, in which the
periodic signal is approximated by a truncated Fourier series. We
provide a new numerical algorithm for computation of the Keplerian
periodogram. This algorithm adaptively increases the parametric
resolution where necessary, in order to uniformly cover all local optima
of the Keplerian fit. Thanks to this improvement, the algorithm provides
more smooth and reliable results with minimized computing demands. We
also derive a fast analytic approximation to the false alarm probability
levels of the Keplerian periodogram. This approximation has the form
(Pz3/2 + Qz)Wexp ( - z), where z is the observed periodogram
maximum, W is proportional to the settled frequency range, and the
coefficients P and Q depend on the maximum eccentricity to scan.},

  abstract = {Aims: We study the impact of the presence of planets on the 
lithium abundance of host stars and evaluate the previous claim that
planet hosts exhibit lithium depletion when compared to their non-host
counterparts. Methods: Using previously published lithium
abundances, we remove the confounding effect of the different
fundamental stellar parameters by applying a multivariable regression on
our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an assumption made
implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends linearly
on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to
distinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the
existence of an offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We
perform this analysis first for stars that present a clear lithium
detection exclusively and include in a second analysis upper lithium
measurements. Results: Our analysis shows that under the
above-mentioned assumption of linearity, an offset in lithium abundance
between planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. This offset is
negative, showing an enhanced depletion for planetary hosts, and is a
statistically significant result. By bootstrapping the error bars, we
concluded that an inflation on the lithium uncertainty estimations by a
factor of larger than 5 is required to render the measured offset
compatible with zero at less than 3-4sigma and make it
non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by our
method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples.
We did so by showing that the offset is reduced down to zero if the
planet-host stars are replaced by comparison stars in a mock planet-host
sample. The offset is also shown to be significant at 3.75sigma when
compared with that of a population in which planet-host and comparison
tags are shuffled, representing a situation in which the tagging is
decorrelated from the presence of orbiting planets. Moreover, the
measured depletion is still significant when one imposes different
constraints on the dataset, such as a limit in planetary mass or
constrain the host temperature to around solar value. We conclude then
that planet-host stars exhibit enhanced lithium depletion when compared
with non-host stars.},

errors in planet radii and includes an "iterative simulation" technique

2-2.8 Earth radii, with lower numbers of smaller and larger planets.
These planets are uniformly distributed with logarithmic period, and the

a larger amplitude around lower-mass stars, which adds to making M
dwarfs excellent targets for extra-solar planet searches. The most
recent velocimeters with a stability of \textasciitilde{}1 m s-1 can detect
very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these stars. Low-mass
small planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most of the known
potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars. 
Aims: Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6 m
telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this
sample. Methods: We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time
series for three M dwarfs observed over \textasciitilde{}five years: GJ 3293 (0.42
M\&sun;), GJ 3341 (0.47 M\&sun;), and GJ 3543 (0.45
M\&sun;). We extracted these RVs through minimum
chi2-matching of each spectrum against a stack of all
observed spectra for the same star that has a high signal-to-noise
ratio. We then compared potential orbital signals against several
stellar activity indicators to distinguish the Keplerian variations
induced by planets from the spurious signals that result from rotational
modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity cycles.
 Results: Two Neptune-mass planets - msin(i) = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1
and 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1Mnept - orbit GJ 3293 with periods P =
30.60 $\pm$ 0.02 d and P = 123.98 $\pm$ 0.38 d, possibly together
with a super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 7.9 $\pm$ 1.4 M$\oplus$ -
with period P = 48.14 $\pm$ 0.12d. A super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 6.1
M$\oplus$ - orbits GJ 3341 with P = 14.207 $\pm$ 0.007d.
The RV variations of GJ 3543, on the other hand, reflect its stellar
activity rather than planetary signals.

lightest ever discovered planets. The minimum mass of the companion to
HD 168746 is of only 0.77 the mass of Saturn and its
orbital period is 6.4 days. The companion to HD
108147 orbits its parent star in 10.9 days and its minimum
mass is 1.34 that of Saturn. Its orbit is characterized by a high
eccentricity, e=0.50, indicating possibly the presence of a second
companion. The detection of Saturn-mass planets by means of the Doppler
technique demands high radial-velocity measurement precision. The two
new candidates were discovered by means of the CORALIE echelle
spectrograph. The instrumental accuracy of CORALIE combined with the
simultaneous ThAr-reference technique has reached a level better than 3
m s-1. On many observed objects the precision is now limited
by photon noise. We present in this paper the weighted cross-correlation
technique, which leads to an improvement in the photon noise of the
computed radial velocity. We discuss as well a modification of the
numerical cross-correlation mask which reduces significantly the
residual perturbation effects produced by telluric absorption lines.

This can be seen as the greatest obstacle in detecting Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars with Doppler spectroscopy regardless of developments in instrumentation and rapidly accumulating amounts of data. We use a statistical model that is not sensitive to aperiodic and/or quasiperiodic variability of stellar origin. We demonstrate the performance of our model by re-analysing the radial velocities of the moderately active star CoRoT-7 (\$$\backslash$log R\_\{$\backslash$rm HK\} = -4.61\$) with a transiting planet whose Doppler signal has proven rather difficult to detect. We find that the signal of the transiting planet can be robustly detected together with signals of two other planet candidates. Our results suggest that rotation periods of moderately active stars can be filtered out of the radial velocity noise, which enables the detections of low-mass planets orbiting such stars.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric properties of exoplanets can be constrained with transit spectroscopy. The signature of atomic sodium NaI, known to be present above the clouds, is a powerful probe of the upper atmosphere, where it can be best detected and characterized at high spectral resolution. Our goal is to obtain a high-resolution transit spectrum of HD189733b in the region around the resonance doublet of NaI at 589 nm, to characterize the absorption signature previously detected from space at low resolution. We analyze archival transit data of HD189733b obtained with the HARPS spectrograph. We retrieve the transit spectrum and light curve of the planet, implementing corrections for telluric contamination and planetary orbital motion. We spectrally resolve the NaI D doublet and measure line contrasts of \$0.64$\backslash$pm0.07$\backslash$\%\$ (D2) and \$0.40$\backslash$pm0.07$\backslash$\%\$ (D1) and FWHMs of \$0.52$\backslash$pm0.08\textasciitilde$\backslash$AA\$. This corresponds to a detection at the 10-\$$\backslash$sigma\$ level of excess of absorption of \$0.32$\backslash$pm0.03$\backslash$\%\$ in a passband of \$2$\backslash$times0.75$\backslash$ $\backslash$AA\$ centered on each line. We derive temperatures of \$2$\backslash$,600$\backslash$pm600\$ K and \$3270$\backslash$pm330\$ K at altitudes of \$9$\backslash$,800$\backslash$pm2$\backslash$,800\$ km and \$12$\backslash$,700$\backslash$pm2$\backslash$,600\$ km in the NaI D1 and D2 line cores, respectively. We measure a temperature gradient of \$$\backslash$sim0.2\$ K km\$\^\{-1\}\$ from comparison with theoretical models. We also detect a blueshift of \$0.16$\backslash$pm0.04$\backslash$ $\backslash$AA\$ (4 \$$\backslash$sigma\$) in the line positions. This blueshift may be due to winds blowing at \$8$\backslash$pm2\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ in the upper layers of the atmosphere. We demonstrate the relevance of studying exoplanet atmospheres with high-resolution spectrographs mounted on 4-meter-class telescopes. Our results pave the way towards in-depth characterization of physical conditions in the atmospheres of many exoplanetary systems with future spectrographs such as ESPRESSO on the VLT or HiReS and METIS on the E-ELT.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the
uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {Context. Stellar activity induces apparent radial velocity (RV) 
variations in late-type main-sequence stars that may hamper the
detection of low-mass planets and the measurement of their mass. 
Aims: We use simultaneous measurements of the active planet host star HD
189733 with high-precision optical photometry by the MOST satellite and
high-resolution spectra by SOPHIE. We apply on this unique dataset a
spot model to predict the activity-induced RV variations and compare
them with the observed ones. Methods: The model is based on the
rotational modulation of the stellar flux. A maximum entropy
regularization is applied to find a unique and stable solution for the
distribution of the active regions versus stellar longitude. The RV
variations are synthesized considering the effects on the line profiles
of the brightness perturbations due to dark spots and bright faculae and
the reduction of the convective blueshifts in the active regions. 
Results: The synthesized RV time series shows a remarkably good
agreement with the observed one although variations on timescales
shorter than 4-5 days cannot be reproduced by our model. Persistent
active longitudes are revealed by the spot modelling. They rotate with
slightly different periods yielding a minimum relative amplitude of the
differential rotation of $\Delta\Omega$/$\Omega$ = 0.23 $\pm$ 0.10.
Moreover, several active regions with an evolution timescale of 2-5 days
and an area of 0.1-0.3 percent of the stellar disc are detected. 
Conclusions: The method proves capable of reducing the power of the
activity-induced RV variations by a factor from 2 to 10 at the rotation
frequency and its harmonics up to the third. Thanks to the
high-precision space-borne photometry delivered by CoRoT, Kepler, or
later PLATO, it is possible to map the longitudinal distribution of
active regions in late-type stars and apply the method presented in this
paper to reduce remarkably the impact of stellar activity on their RV
jitter allowing us to confirm the detection of low-mass planets or
refine the measurement of their mass.},

  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201219917},
  abstract = {Context. Radial velocity (RV) time series are strongly impacted by the 
presence of stellar activity. In a series of papers, we have
reconstructed solar RV variations over a full solar cycle from observed
solar structures (spots and plages) and studied their impact on the
detectability of an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of the Sun
as seen edge-on from a neighbour star in several typical cases. We found
that the convective contribution dominates the RV times series. 
Aims: The objective of this paper is twofold: to determine detection
limits on a Sun-like star seen edge-on with different levels of
convection and to estimate the performance of the activity correction
using a Ca index. Methods: We apply two methods to compute the
detection limits: a correlation-based method and a local power analysis
method, which both take into account the temporal structure of the
observations. Furthermore, we test two methods using a Ca index to
correct for the convective contribution to the RV: a sinusoidal fit to
the Ca variations and a linear fit to the RV-Ca relation. In both cases,
we use observed Ca and reconstructed Ca to study the various effects and
limitations of our estimations. Results: We confirm that an
excellent sampling is necessary to have detection limits below 1
MEarth (e.g. 0.2-0.3 MEarth) when there is no
convection and a low RV noise. With convection, the detection limit is
always above 7 MEarth. The two correction methods perform
similarly when the Ca time series are noisy, leading to a significant
improvement (down to a few MEarth), which is above the 1
MEarth limit. With a very good Ca noise (signal to noise
ratio, S/N, around 130), the sinusoidal method does not get
significantly better because it is dominated by the fact that the solar
cycle is not sinusoidal, but the RV-Ca method can reach the 1
MEarth for an excellent Ca noise level. Conclusions:
For Sun-like conditions and under the simplifying assumptions
considered, we first conclude that the detection limit of a few
MEarth planet can be reached providing good sampling and Ca
noise. The detection of a 1 MEarth may be possible, but only
with an excellent temporal sampling and an excellent Ca index noise
level: we estimate that a probability larger than 50\% to detect a 1
MEarth at 1.2 AU requires more than 1000 well-sampled
observations and a Ca S/N larger than 130.},

Planet (SOAP) code that estimates in a simple way the photometric and
radial velocity (RV) variations induced by active regions. The
inhibition of the convective blueshift (CB) inside active regions is
considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a
quadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast
ratio. SOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is
dominated by the inhibition of the CB effect. For spots, this effect
becomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of
a major active region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio
between the FWHM and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the cross
correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region
responsible for the signal for stars with v sin i $<$=8 km
s\textendash{}1. A ratio smaller than three implies a spot, while a
larger ratio implies a plage. Using the observation of HD 189733, we
show that SOAP 2.0 manages to reproduce the activity variation as well
as previous simulations when a spot is dominating the activity-induced
variation. In addition, SOAP 2.0 also reproduces the activity variation
induced by a plage on the slowly rotating star $\alpha$ Cen B, which is
not possible using previous simulations. Following these results, SOAP
2.0 can be used to estimate the signal induced by spots and plages, but
also to correct for it when a major active region is dominating the RV
variation.

However, the spectroscopic diagnoses are providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar contaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as a function of the parameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented into the pastis planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation. It might also produce a bisector variation anticorrelated with the radial velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width at half-maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial velocity planets. We review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis to monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD 16702, an unresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.},

  isbn = {1050-3390},
  abstract = {Stellar surface structure in the form of cool spots create spectral distortions which can be detected as radial velocity (RV) variations that are modulated with the rotation period of the star. These RV variations act as ''noise'' which can obscure the RV signal due to planets. Here the predicted RV and line profile shape variations using realistic spot models and an RV ''measurement'' technique that mimics current methods are calculated for cool spots spanning a range of parameters pertinent to activity in solar-type stars (slow rotation, small spots). For a stars with the same projected rotational velocity as the Sun, the RV amplitude due to a spot comparable to the largest sunspot is about 3 m/s and is less than 1 m/s for a more modest sized starspot. These simulations also show the '' v sin i '' amplification effect; for a given spot size the RV amplitude increases linearly with v sin i. All of these findings confirm the results of Saar \& Donahue who also looked at activity related RV variations. The RV noise due to stellar activity will thus be higher in more rapidly rotating stars because 1) the RV amplitude is higher due to the v sin i amplification effect, and 2) stars with higher rotation tend to have more activity (more and larger spots). Searching for Saturn-like planets is best suited for those stars with v sin i $<$ 3 km/s. The RV amplitude
increases linearly with spot filling factor and is about 7 m/s for a filling factor of 0.2\% and as high as 20 m/s for a filling factor of 1\% ( v sin i = 3 km/s) However, if spots are uniformly distributed about the equator, the RV noise due to sunspot-sized spots is always less than about 1 m/s. For modest rotations rates (v sin i = 15 km/s) temperature sensitive lines have an amplitude 15\% lower than temperature insensitive lines. An RV analysis of active stars as a function of temperature sensitive lines may help distinguish between RV signals due to spots and those due to companions. Restricting RV measurements to temperature sensitive lines (line strength increasing in the starspot) should also minimize RV noise due to stellar activity. Combining precise stellar radial velocity measurements with line shape information, one may be able to map spot features on slowly rotating stars for which the Doppler imaging technique is ill-suited.},

In particular, some radial velocities (RVs) measured using Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) spectra have been shown to be inaccurate, throwing some doubt on the validity of a number of planet detections. Motivated by these results, we have begun the Reanalysis of Archival FEROS specTra (RAFT) programme and here we discuss the first results from this work. We have reanalyzed FEROS data for the stars HD 11977, HD 47536, HD 70573, HD 110014 and HD 122430, all of which are claimed to have at least one planetary companion. We have reduced the raw data and computed the radial velocity variations of these stars, achieving a long-term precision of $\sim$10 m s-1 on the known stable star $\tau$ Ceti, and in good agreement with the residuals to our fits. We confirm the existence of planets around HD 11977, HD 47536 and HD 110014, but with different orbital parameters than those previously published. In addition, we found no evidence of the second planet candidate around HD 47536, nor any companions orbiting HD 122430 and HD 70573. Finally, we report the discovery of a second planet around HD 110014, with a minimum mass of 3.1 MJup and a orbital period of 130 d. Analysis of activity indicators allows us to confirm the reality of our results and also to measure the impact of magnetic activity on our RV measurements. These results confirm that very metal poor stars down to [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.7 dex, can indeed form giant planets given the right conditions.},

  abstract = {The photometric data collected during 2001 season OGLE-III planetary/low 
luminosity object transit campaign were reanalyzed with the new transit
search technique -- the BLS method by Kovacs, Zucker and Mazeh. In
addition to all presented in our original paper transits, additional 13
objects with transiting low-luminosity companions were discovered. We
present here a supplement to our original catalog -- the photometric
data, light curves and finding charts of all 13 new objects. The model
fits to the transit light curves indicate that a few new objects may be
Jupiter-sized (R$<$1.6 R\_Jup). OGLE-TR-56 is a particularly interesting
case. Its transit has only 13mmag depth, short duration and a period of
1.21190 days. Model fit indicates that the companion may be Saturn-sized
if the passage were central. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are
encouraged for final classification of the transiting objects as
planets, brown dwarfs or late M-type dwarf stars. We also provide the
most recent ephemerides of other most promising planetary transits:
OGLE-TR-10 and OGLE-TR-40 based on observations collected in June 2002.

This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R $\oplus$, and orbital period, up to 50~days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is \textasciitilde{}0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7~days and between large and small radii at 3 R $\oplus$. The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of \textasciitilde{}3 R $\oplus$ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on the combination of transit timing variations (TTVs) and dynamical stability. Correlated TTVs provide evidence that the pair of bodies is in the same physical system. Orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of the transiting companions that are in the planetary regime. This paper describes a non-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of TTVs based on the correlation of two TTV data sets. We apply this method to an analysis of the TTVs of two stars with multiple transiting planet candidates identified by Kepler . We confirm four transiting planets in two multiple-planet systems based on their TTVs and the constraints imposed by dynamical stability. An additional three candidates in these same systems are not confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets once further observations and analyses are possible. If all were confirmed, these systems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. Our results demonstrate that TTVs provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting planets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for which Doppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. Continued Kepler observations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses and orbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets. If Kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysis could likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transiting planets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.},

The two planets have orbital periods of 195.0 and 530.3 days, with eccentricities of 0.11 and 0.18. The minimum masses for these planets are 0.89 and 0.50 M J , respectively. The orbits are close enough to each other, and the planets are sufficiently massive, that the planets are gravitationally interacting with each other, with their eccentricities and arguments of periastron varying with periods of 2300-2700 yr. While large uncertainties remain in the orbital eccentricities, our orbital integration calculations indicate that our derived orbits would be dynamically stable for at least 10 8 yr. With a metallicity [Fe/H] of -0.68, HD 155358 is tied with the K1 III giant planet host star HD 47536 for the lowest metallicity of any planet host star yet found. Thus, a star with only 21\% of the heavy-element content of our Sun was still able to form a system of at least two Jovian-mass planets and have their orbits evolve to semimajor axes of 0.6-1.2 AU.},

  abstract = {The hundreds of multiple planetary systems discovered by the Kepler mission are typically observed to reside in close-in (\$$\backslash$lesssim0.5\$ AU), low-eccentricity, and low-inclination orbits. We run N-body experiments to study the effect that unstable outer (\$$\backslash$gtrsim1\$ AU) giant planets, whose end orbital configurations resemble those in the Radial Velocity population, have on these close-in multiple Super-Earth systems. Our experiments show that the giant planets greatly reduce the multiplicity of the inner Super-Earths and the surviving population can have large eccentricities (\$e$\backslash$gtrsim0.3\$) and inclinations (\$i$\backslash$gtrsim20\^$\backslash$circ\$) at levels that anti-correlate with multiplicity. Consequently, this model predicts the existence of a population of dynamically hot single-transiting planets with typical eccentricities and inclinations in the ranges of \$$\backslash$sim 0.2-0.5\$ and \$$\backslash$sim 10\^$\backslash$circ-40\^$\backslash$circ\$. We show that these results can explain the following observations: (i) the recent eccentricity measurements of Kepler super-Earths from transit durations, (ii) the tentative observation that single-transiting systems have a wider distribution of stellar obliquity angles compared to the multiple-transiting systems; (iii) the architecture of some eccentric super-Earths discovered by Radial Velocity surveys such as HD125612c. Future observations from TESS will reveal many more dynamically hot single transiting planets, for which follow up Radial Velocity studies will be able to test our models and see whether they have outer giant planets.},

We describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and complementary ground-based observations that support the planetary nature of the companion. Methods: We used CoRoT colours
information, good angular resolution ground-based photometric observations in- and out- of transit, adaptive optics imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and preliminary results from radial velocity
measurements, to test the diluted eclipsing binary scenarios. The parameters of the host star were derived from optical spectra, which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive parameters of the companion. Results: We examined all conceivable cases of false positives carefully, and all the tests support the planetary hypothesis. Blends with separation $>$0.40\textasciiacute\textasciiacute{}or triple
systems are almost excluded with a 8 \texttimes{} 10-4 risk left. We conclude that, inasmuch we have been exhaustive, we have discovered a planetary companion, named CoRoT-7b, for which we derive a period of 0.853 59 $\pm$ 3 \texttimes{} 10-5 day and a radius of Rp = 1.68 $\pm$ 0.09 R\_Earth. Analysis of preliminary
radial velocity data yields an upper limit of 21 M\_Earth for the companion mass, supporting the finding. Conclusions: CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a measured radius. This object
illustrates what will probably become a common situation with missions such as Kepler, namely the need to establish the planetary origin of transits in the absence of a firm radial velocity detection and mass measurement. The composition of CoRoT-7b remains loosely constrained without a precise mass. A very high surface temperature on its irradiated face, $\approx$1800-2600 K at the substellar point, and a very low one, $\approx$50 K, on its dark face assuming no atmosphere, have been derived.
The CoRoT\hspace{0.6em}space mission, launched on 27 December 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany, and Spain. First CoRoT\hspace{0.6em}data are available to the public from the CoRoT\hspace{0.6em}archive: http://idoc-corot.ias.u-psud.fr. The  complementary observations were obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by NRC in Canada, INSU-CNRS in France, and the University of Hawaii; ESO Telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal Observatories under programme ID 081.C-0413(C), DDT 282.C-5015; the IAC80 telescope operated by the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Tenerife at the Observatorio del Teide; the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias; and at the Anglo-Australian Telescope that have been funded by the Optical Infrared Coordination network (OPTICON), a major international collaboration supported by the Research Infrastructures Programme of the European
Commissions Sixth Framework Programme; Radial-velocity observations were obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93m telescope of Observatoire de Haute Provence, France.},

Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1\%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm \textendash{}3 , suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than 2 R $\oplus$ . Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H 2 O).},

We have performed detailed dynamical stability simulations which show that the HD~154857 two-planet system is stable on timescales of at least 108~yr.

planet formation encompasses many complex and competing processes. In
this series of papers, we develop and upgrade a population synthesis
model as a tool to identify the dominant physical effects and to
calibrate the range of physical conditions. Recent planet searches have
led to the discovery of many multiple-planet systems. Any theoretical
models of their origins must take into account dynamical interactions
between emerging protoplanets. Here, we introduce a prescription to
approximate the close encounters between multiple planets. We apply this
method to simulate the growth, migration, and dynamical interaction of
planetary systems. Our models show that in relatively massive disks,
several gas giants and rocky/icy planets emerge, migrate, and undergo
dynamical instability. Secular perturbation between planets leads to
orbital crossings, eccentricity excitation, and planetary ejection. In
disks with modest masses, two or less gas giants form with multiple
super-Earths. Orbital stability in these systems is generally maintained
and they retain the kinematic structure after gas in their natal disks
is depleted. These results reproduce the observed planetary
mass-eccentricity and semimajor axis-eccentricity correlations. They
also suggest that emerging gas giants can scatter residual cores to the
outer disk regions. Subsequent in situ gas accretion onto these cores
can lead to the formation of distant (gsim 30 AU) gas giants with nearly
circular orbits.},

  shorttitle = {The {{First Circumbinary Planet Found}} by {{Microlensing}}},
  abstract = {We present the analysis of the first circumbinary planet microlensing event, OGLE-2007-BLG-349. This event has a strong planetary signal that is best fit with a mass ratio of \$q $\backslash$approx 3.4$\backslash$times 10\^\{-4\}\$, but there is an additional signal due to an additional lens mass, either another planet or another star. We find acceptable light curve fits with two classes of models: 2-planet models (with a single host star) and circumbinary planet models. The light curve also reveals a significant microlensing parallax effect, which constraints the mass of the lens system to be \$M\_L $\backslash$approx 0.7 M\_$\backslash$odot\$. Hubble Space Telescope images resolve the lens and source stars from their neighbors, and indicate excess flux due to the star(s) in the lens system. This is consistent with the predicted flux from the circumbinary models, where the lens mass is shared between two stars, but there is not enough flux to be consistent with the 2-planet, 1-star models. So, only the circumbinary models are consistent with the HST data. They indicate a planet of mass \$m\_c = 80$\backslash$pm 13 M\_$\backslash$oplus\$, orbiting a pair of M-dwarfs with masses of \$M\_A = 0.41$\backslash$pm 0.07 M\_$\backslash$odot\$ and \$M\_B = 0.30$\backslash$pm 0.07 M\_$\backslash$odot\$, which makes this the lowest mass circumbinary planet system known. The ratio of the planet:center-of-mass separation to the separations of the two stars is \textasciitilde{}40, so unlike most of the circumbinary planets found by Kepler, the planet does not orbit near the stability limit.},

On average, planets with radii up to R P = 1.5 R $\oplus$ increase in density with increasing radius. Above 1.5 R $\oplus$ , the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1.5 R $\oplus$ , we find $\rho$ P = 2.43 + 3.39( R P / R $\oplus$ ) g cm \textendash{}3 for R P $<$ 1.5 R $\oplus$ , which is consistent with rocky compositions. For 1.5 $\leq$ R P / R $\oplus$ $<$ 4, we find M P / M $\oplus$ = 2.69( R P / R $\oplus$ ) 0.93 . The rms of planet masses to the fit between 1.5 and 4 R $\oplus$ is 4.3 M $\oplus$ with reduced $\chi$ 2 = 6.2. The large scatter indicates a diversity in planet composition at a given radius. The compositional diversity can be due to planets of a given volume (as determined by their large H/He envelopes) containing rocky cores of different masses or compositions.},

We report the occurrence rate of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than 50 days), based on precise Doppler measurements of 166 Sun-like stars. We measured increasing planet occurrence with decreasing planet mass (M). Extrapolation of a power-law mass distribution fitted to our measurements, df/dlogM = 0.39 M-0.48, predicts that 23\% of stars harbor a close-in Earth-mass planet (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 Earth masses). Theoretical models of planet formation predict a deficit of planets in the domain from 5 to 30 Earth masses and with orbital periods less than 50 days. This region of parameter space is in fact well populated, implying that such models need substantial revision.},

  abstract = {Gas giants orbiting interior to the ice line are thought to have been 
displaced from their formation locations by processes that remain
debated. Here we uncover several new metallicity trends, which together
may indicate that two competing mechanisms deliver close-in giant
planets: gentle disk migration, operating in environments with a range
of metallicities, and violent planet-planet gravitational interactions,
primarily triggered in metal-rich systems in which multiple giant
planets can form. First, we show with 99.1\% confidence that giant
planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 1 AU orbiting metal-poor
stars ([Fe/H] $<$ 0) are confined to lower eccentricities than those
orbiting metal-rich stars. Second, we show with 93.3\% confidence that
eccentric proto-hot Jupiters undergoing tidal circularization primarily
orbit metal-rich stars. Finally, we show that only metal-rich stars host
a pile-up of hot Jupiters, helping account for the lack of such a
pile-up in the overall Kepler sample. Migration caused by stellar
perturbers (e.g., stellar Kozai) is unlikely to account for the trends.
These trends further motivate follow-up theoretical work addressing
which hot Jupiter migration theories can also produce the observed
population of eccentric giant planets between 0.1 and 1 AU.},

  volume = {154},
  abstract = {During the last 13 years, the radial velocity monitoring of about 570 G and K dwarfs in the solar vicinity has permitted an almost complete census of the spectroscopic binaries. These detections, combined with discoveries from recent high-precision radial velocity surveys (OHP, Lick, McDonald), are already sufficient to describe some characteristics of the mass function f(m\_2) below the substellar limit. This function is shown to be moderately rising for m\_2 going down to about ten Jupiter masses (M\_Jup). An impressive peak of the function is observed below 5 M\_Jup. We can compare this characteristic of the mass function with a discontinuity of the orbital eccentricities (e) of substellar companions also observed at about 10 M\_Jup. We can note that: - The two
discontinuities observed for f(m\_2) and for the (log m\_2,e) distribution take place at similar masses. This correspondence strongly suggests two different formation mechanisms for objects below 5-7 M\_Jup and above 7 M\_Jup. - The low-mass tail of spectroscopic binaries exists down below 10 M\_Jup. The distribution of orbital eccentricities on the domain of brown dwarfs is similar to the distribution of ordinary spectroscopic binaries. - The upper limit for the mass of giant planets seems close to 5 M\_Jup and the lightest brown dwarfs could have masses as low as 5 to 10 M\_Jup.},

We show that taking these effects into account can lead to much more rapid formation of giant planets, making it compatible with the typical disc lifetimes inferred from observations of young circumstellar discs. This speed up is due to the fact that migration prevents the severe depletion of the feeding zone as observed in in situ calculations. Hence, the growing planet is never isolated and it can reach cross-over mass on a much shorter timescale. To illustrate the range of planets that can form in our model, we describe a set of simulations in which we have varied some of the initial parameters and compare the final masses and semi-major axes with those inferred from observed extra-solar planets.},

At the disk center, the active region line bisectors are always displaced to the red and their shape is heavily modified. This red-shift nearly compensates the convective blue-shift for strong magnetic fields, suggesting that the inhibition of convection in magnetic regions might be responsible for the red-shift instead of the often invoked
'downdraft'. Moving from the center to the limb, at about 0.56 solar radii, the red-shift changes to a slight blue shift. This effect might explain, without the need of invoking a poleward meridional flow, why the center to limb red-shift of the line wavelengths is found to be smaller along the solar equator than along the meridian on large ensembles of data.},

probability distribution is known for any number of observations, so that its usefulness for small samples is unquestionable. Comparison of the AoV test with other tests in use demonstrate that for large samples it is at least as powerful as any of them. Examples of application of the AoV method for photometric observations are discussed. An error in the phase dispersion minimization method, namely an incorrect
probability distribution and significance criterion, is also discussed. It is argued that the power of the Lafler and Kinman test is comparable to that of the AoV2 test, the AoV test with narrow bins, containing two observations each. However, the AoV2 test is less powerful than any AoV test with a reduced number of bins and so is the Lafler and Kinman test.},

In particular, we assume that the planet\textendash{}metallicity correlation is a power law below some critical saturation threshold, and that the probability of hosting at least one planet is unity for stars with metallicity above the threshold. We then are able to explain the discrepancy between the tentative detection and null detection in previous studies regarding the planet\textendash{}metallicity correlation for small planets. In particular, we find that the null detection of this correlation can be attributed to the combination of high planet occurrence rate and low detection efficiency. Therefore, a planet\textendash{}metallicity correlation for small planets cannot be ruled out. We propose that stars with metallicities lower than the solar value are better targets for testing the planet\textendash{}metallicity correlation for small planets.},

We present a new orbital solution after removing the two main contributions to the stellar jitter, one that varies with the photometric period and another that varies with the synodic period of the star+planet system. We use a new method to determine these jitter components, considering them as a second and third signals in the system. A discussion on possible magnetic star-planet-interaction is included, based on the Bayesian analysis of the activity indices. We propose two possible sources for flare events of this star: one related to the geometry of the system and the relative movement of the star+planet, and a second one purely stochastic source that is related to the evolution of stellar active regions. Also, we observe for the first time the magnetic field of the star, from spectropolarimetric data.},

  abstract = {We present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets 
around the bright (V=5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star HD219134. This is
the first result of the Rocky Planet Search program with HARPS-N on the
TNG in La Palma. The inner planet orbits the star in 3.0937 +/-0.0004
days, on a quasi-circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.0382 +/-
0.0003 AU. Spitzer observations allowed us to detect the transit of the
planet in front of the star making HD219134b the nearest known
transiting planet to date. From the amplitude of the radial-velocity
variation (2.33 +/- 0.24 m/s) and observed depth of the transit (359 +/-
38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.46 +/- 0.47
M\_\{$\backslash$oplus\} and 1.606 +/- 0.086 R\_\{$\backslash$oplus\} leading to a mean density of
5.89 +/- 1.17 g/cc, suggesting a rocky composition. One additional
planet with minimum mass of 2.67 +/- 0.59 M\_\{$\backslash$oplus\} moves on a
close-in, quasi-circular orbit with a period of 6.765 +/- 0.005 days.
The third planet in the system has a period of 46.78 +/- 0.16 days and a
minimum mass of 8.7 +/- 1.1 M\{$\backslash$oplus\}, at 0.234 +/- 0.002 AU from the
star. Its eccentricity is 0.32 +/- 0.14. The period of this planet is
close to the rotational period of the star estimated from variations of
activity indicators (42.3 +/- 0.1 days). The planetary origin of the
signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation
at the corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive
parameters. Finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of
62 +/- 6 M\_\{$\backslash$oplus\} orbits the star in 1190 days, on an eccentric orbit
(e=0.27 +/- 0.11) at a distance of 2.14 +/- 0.27 AU.},

In order to infer the posterior probability distribution we have to decide how to explore parameter space. Here we compare three prescriptions for how parameter space is navigated, discussing their relative merits. We consider Metropolis-Hasting sampling, nested sampling and affine-invariant ensemble MCMC sampling. We focus on their performance on toy-model Gaussian likelihoods and on a real-world cosmological data set. We outline the sampling algorithms themselves and elaborate on performance diagnostics such as convergence time, scope for parallelisation, dimensional scaling, requisite tunings and suitability for non-Gaussian distributions. We find that nested sampling delivers high-fidelity estimates for posterior statistics at low computational cost, and should be adopted in favour of Metropolis-Hastings in many cases. Affine-invariant MCMC is competitive when computing clusters can be utilised for massive parallelisation. Affine-invariant MCMC and existing extensions to nested sampling naturally probe multi-modal and curving distributions.},

  abstract = {We present a survey of 41 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) for exomoons using Bayesian photodynamics, more than tripling the number of KOIs surveyed with this technique. We find no compelling evidence for exomoons although thirteen KOIs yield spurious detections driven by instrumental artifacts, stellar activity and/or perturbations from unseen bodies. Regarding the latter, we find seven KOIs exhibiting $>$5 sigma evidence of transit timing variations, including the 'mega-Earth' Kepler-10c, likely indicating an additional planet in that system. We exploit the moderately large sample of 57 unique KOIs surveyed to date to infer several useful statistics. For example, although there is a diverse range in sensitivities, we find that we are sensitive to Pluto-Charon mass-ratio systems for \textasciitilde{}40\% of KOIs studied and Earth-Moon mass-ratios for 1 in 8 cases. In terms of absolute mass, our limits probe down to 1.7 Ganymede masses, with a sensitivity to Earth-mass moons for 1 in 3 cases studied and to the smallest moons capable of sustaining an Earth-like atmosphere (0.3 Earth masses) for 1 in 4. Despite the lack of positive detections to date, we caution against drawing conclusions yet, since our most interesting objects remain under analysis. Finally, we point out that had we searched for the photometric transit signals of exomoons alone, rather than using photodynamics, we estimate that 1 in 4 KOIs would have erroneously been concluded to harbor exomoons due to residual time correlated noise in the Kepler data, posing a serious problem for alternative methods.},

(SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It
is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific
problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a
2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical
coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field
Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space
mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a
dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the
demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing
its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science
Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study
Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission
(DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m,
Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA.
This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green
et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et.
(2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater
sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m
designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the
primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer
facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the
baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets
around nearby stars.},

Their method is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, which makes use of the ``reversible jump'' methodology described by Green. We describe an alternative MCMC method which views the parameters of the model as a (marked) point process, extending methods suggested by Ripley to create a Markov birth-death process with an appropriate stationary distribution. Our method is easy to implement, even in the case of data in more than one dimension, and we illustrate it on both univariate and bivariate data. There appears to be considerable potential for applying these ideas to other contexts, as an alternative to more general reversible jump methods, and we conclude with a brief discussion of how this might be achieved.},

  abstract = {We present the latest velocities for ten multiplanet systems, including a re-analysis of archival Keck and Lick data, resulting in improved velocities that supersede our previously published measurements. We derive updated orbital fits for 10 Lick and Keck systems, including two systems (HD 11964, HD 183263) for which we provide confirmation of second planets only tentatively identified elsewhere, and two others (HD 187123 and HD 217107) for which we provide a major revision of the outer planet's orbit. We compile orbital elements from the literature to generate a catalog of the 28 published multiple-planet systems around stars within 200 pc. From this catalog we find several intriguing patterns emerging: (1) including those systems with long-term radial velocity trends, at least 28\% of known planetary systems appear to contain multiple planets; (2) planets in multiple-planet systems have somewhat smaller eccentricities than single planets; and (3) the distribution of orbital distances of planets in multiplanet systems and single planets are inconsistent: single-planet systems show a pileup at P 3 days and a jump near 1 AU, while multiplanet systems show a more uniform distribution in log-period. In addition, among all planetary systems we find the following. (1) There may be an emerging, positive correlation between stellar mass and giant-planet semimajor axis. (2) Exoplanets with M sin i $>$ 1 M Jup more massive than Jupiter have eccentricities broadly distributed across 0 $<$ e $<$ 0.5, while lower mass exoplanets exhibit a distribution peaked near e = 0.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of the first extrasolar planet, ET-1 (HD 
102195b), using the Exoplanet Tracker (ET), a new-generation Doppler
instrument. The planet orbits HD 102195, a young star with solar
metallicity that may be part of the local association. The planet
imparts radial velocity variability to the star with a semiamplitude of
63.4+/-2.0 m s-1 and a period of 4.11 days. The planetary
minimum mass (msini) is 0.488MJ+/-0.015MJ. The
planet was initially detected in the spring of 2005 with the Kitt Peak
National Observatory (KPNO) 0.9 m coud{\'e} feed telescope. The
detection was confirmed by radial velocity observations with the ET at
the KPNO 2.1 m telescope and also at the 9 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope
(HET) with its High Resolution Spectrograph. This planetary discovery
with a 0.9 m telescope around a V=8.05 magnitude star was made possible
by the high throughput of the instrument: 49\% measured from the fiber
output to the detector. The ET's interferometer-based approach is an
effective method for planet detection. In addition, the ET concept is
adaptable to multiple-object Doppler observations or very high precision
observations with a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph to separate
stellar fringes over a broad wavelength band. In addition to
spectroscopic observations of HD 102195, we obtained brightness
measurements with one of the automated photometric telescopes at
Fairborn Observatory. Those observations reveal that HD 102195 is a
spotted variable star with an amplitude of \textasciitilde{}0.015 mag and a 12.3+/-0.3
day period. This is consistent with spectroscopically observed Ca II H
and K emission levels and line-broadening measurements but inconsistent
with rotational modulation of surface activity as the cause of the
radial velocity variability. Our photometric observations rule out
transits of the planetary companion.},

We obtain further ground based photometry of the larger planet with the NITES telescope, demonstrating the presence of large transit timing variations (TTVs) of over an hour.

  abstract = {Discoveries from the prime Kepler mission demonstrated that small planets ($<$ 3 Earth-radii) are common outcomes of planet formation. While Kepler detected many such planets, all but a handful orbit faint, distant stars and are not amenable to precise follow up measurements. Here, we report the discovery of two small planets transiting EPIC-206011691, a bright (K = 9.4) M0 dwarf located 65\$$\backslash$pm\$6 pc from Earth. We detected the transiting planets in photometry collected during Campaign 3 of NASA's K2 mission. Analysis of transit light curves reveals that the planets have small radii compared to their host star, 2.60 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 0.14\% and 3.15 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 0.20\%, respectively. We obtained follow up NIR spectroscopy of $\backslash$epic to constrain host star properties, which imply planet sizes of 1.59 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 0.43 Earth-radii and 1.92 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 0.53 Earth-radii, respectively, straddling the boundary between high-density, rocky planets and low-density planets with thick gaseous envelopes. The planets have orbital periods of 9.32414 days and 15.50120 days, respectively, and have a period ratio of 1.6624, very near to the 5:3 mean motion resonance, which may be a record of the system's formation history. Transit timing variations (TTVs) due to gravitational interactions between the planets may be detectable using ground-based telescopes. Finally, this system offers a convenient laboratory for studying the bulk composition and atmospheric properties of small planets with low equilibrium temperatures.},

The giant planet metallicity correlation has now been widely accepted, but questions remain as to whether the metallicity correlation extends to the small terrestrial-sized planets. Here, we report
metallicities for a sample of 518 stars in the Kepler field that have no detected transiting planets and compare their metallicity distribution to a sample of stars that hosts small planets (\{R\}p$\backslash$lt 1.7 \{R\}$\backslash$oplus ). Importantly, both samples have been analyzed in a homogeneous manner using the same set of tools (Stellar Parameters Classification tool). We find the average metallicity of the sample of stars without detected transiting planets to be
\{[\{\{m\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{SNTP,\{dwarf\}\}=-0.02+/- 0.02 \{dex\} and the sample of stars hosting small planets to be
\{[\{\{m\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{STP\}=-0.02+/- 0.02 \{dex\}. The average metallicities of the two samples are indistinguishable within the uncertainties, and the two-sample Kolmogorov\textendash{}Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.68 (0.41$\sigma$), indicating a failure to reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent
population. We conclude that the homogeneous analysis of the data presented here supports the hypothesis that stars hosting small planets have a metallicity similar to stars with no known transiting planets in the same area of the sky.},

We report on 17,230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that meets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed transit events, detection statistic (i.e., signal to noise ratio) in excess of the search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting planet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search for additional planets adds 16,802 transit signals for a total of 34,032; this far exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs. There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final Kepler transit search. Comparison of the transit signals against a set of 3,402 well established, high quality Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) yields a recovery rate of 99.8\%. The high recovery rate must be weighed against a large number of false alarm detections. We examine characteristics of the planet population implied by the transiting planet model fits with emphasis on detections that would represent small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of their host stars.},

If we can find such an Earth-analogue around one of the stars in the immediate solar neighbourhood, we could potentially even study it in such great detail to address the question of its potential habitability. Several groups have focused their planet detection efforts on the nearest stars. Our team is currently performing an intensive observing campaign on the $\alpha$ Centauri system using the High Efficiency and Resolution Canterbury University Large {\'E}chelle Spectrograph (Hercules) at the 1 m McLellan telescope at Mt John University Observatory in New Zealand. The goal of our project is to obtain such a large number of radial velocity (RV) measurements with sufficiently high temporal sampling to become sensitive to signals of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of the two stars in this binary system. Over the past few years, we have collected more than 45 000 spectra for both stars combined. These data are currently processed by an advanced version of our RV reduction pipeline, which eliminates the effect of spectral cross-contamination. Here we present simulations of the expected detection sensitivity to low-mass planets in the habitable zone by the Hercules programme for various noise levels. We also discuss our expected sensitivity to the purported Earth-mass planet in a 3.24-day orbit announced by Dumusque et al. (2012).},

based on the null results from two of the largest direct imaging surveys
published to date. Combining the measured contrast curves from 22 of the
stars observed with the VLT NACO adaptive optics system by Masciadri and
coworkers and 48 of the stars observed with the VLT NACO SDI and MMT SDI
devices by Biller and coworkers (for a total of 60 unique stars), we
consider what distributions of planet masses and semimajor axes can be
ruled out by these data, based on Monte Carlo simulations of planet
populations. We can set the following upper limit with 95\% confidence:
the fraction of stars with planets with semimajor axis between 20 and
100 AU, and mass above 4 MJup, is 20\% or less. Also, with a
distribution of planet mass of dN/dM propto M-1.16 in
the range of 0.5-13 MJup, we can rule out a power-law
distribution for semimajor axis (dN/da propto a$\alpha$) with
index 0 and upper cutoff of 18 AU, and index -0.5 with an upper cutoff
of 48 AU. For the distribution suggested by Cumming et al., a power-law
of index -0.61, we can place an upper limit of 75 AU on the
semimajor axis distribution. In general, we find that even null results
from direct imaging surveys are very powerful in constraining the
distributions of giant planets (0.5-13 MJup) at large
separations, but more work needs to be done to close the gap between
planets that can be detected by direct imaging, and those to which the
radial velocity method is sensitive.},

at the ESO Coud{\'e} Echelle Spectrometer (CES) on La Silla, using
the Long Camera from Nov. 1992 to April 1998. The CES survey has
monitored 37 late-type (F8V - M5V) stars in the southern hemisphere for
variations in their differential radial velocities (RV) in order to
detect Doppler reflex motions caused by planetary companions. This led
to the discovery of the first extrasolar planet in an Earth-like orbit
around the young (ZAMS) and active G0V star iota Horologii (K{\"u}rster
et al. $\backslash$cite\{martin00\}). Here we present the RV results for all survey
stars and perform a statistical examination of the whole data-set. Each
star is tested for RV variability, RV trends (linear and non-linear) and
significant periodic signals. beta Hyi and epsilon Ind are identified as
long-term, low-amplitude RV variables. Furthermore, for 30 CES survey
stars we determine quantitative upper mass-limits for giant planets
based on our long-term RV results. We find that the CES Long Camera
survey would have detected short-period (``51 Peg-type'') planets around
all 30 stars but no planets with msin i $<$ 1 \{M\}\_Jup at orbital
separations larger than 2 AU. Finally, we demonstrate that the CES
planet search can be continued without applying velocity corrections to
the RV results coming from the currently installed Very Long Camera at
the CES. Based on observations collected at the European Southern

is asymptotically normal and can work (in a certain sense) even in a

wrong. This test is also very simple for practical use. We apply it to
several known extrasolar planetary systems and find that our method

astronomical practice, but prevents us from hasty conclusions in other

  abstract = {Host star metallicity provides a measure of the conditions in protoplanetary disks at the time of planet formation. Using a sample of over 20,000 Kepler stars with spectroscopic metallicities from the LAMOST survey, we explore how the exoplanet population depends on host star metallicity as a function of orbital period and planet size. We find that exoplanets with orbital periods less than 10 days are preferentially found around metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] $\simeq$ 0.15 $\pm$ 0.05 dex). The occurrence rates of these hot exoplanets increases to $\sim$30\% for super-solar metallicity stars from $\sim$10\% for stars with a sub-solar metallicity. Cooler exoplanets, which reside at longer orbital periods and constitute the bulk of the exoplanet population with an occurrence rate of $\greaterequivlnt$90\%, have host star metallicities consistent with solar. At short orbital periods, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/152/6/187/ajaa41a3ieqn1.gif] \$P$\backslash$lt 10\$ days, the difference in host star metallicity is largest for hot rocky planets ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/152/6/187/ajaa41a3ieqn2.gif] \$$\backslash$lt 1.7$\backslash$,R\_{\o}plus \$ ), where the metallicity difference is [Fe/H] $\simeq$ 0.25 $\pm$ 0.07 dex. The excess of hot rocky planets around metal-rich stars implies they either share a formation mechanism with hot Jupiters, or trace a planet trap at the protoplanetary disk inner edge, which is metallicity dependent. We do not find statistically significant evidence for a previously identified trend that small planets toward the habitable zone are preferentially found around low-metallicity stars. Refuting or confirming this trend requires a larger sample of spectroscopic metallicities.},

Here, we offer the contrasting view that a substantial fraction of the hot Jupiter population formed in situ via the core-accretion process. We show that under conditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas accretion can be initiated by super-Earth-type planets, comprising 10\textendash{}20 Earth masses of refractory material. An in situ formation scenario leads to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter than $\sim$100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare. High-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their detection.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets by the satellite CoRoT. Aims. We aim at a characterization of the planetary bulk parameters, which allow us to further investigate the formation and evolution of the planetary systems and the main properties of the host stars. Methods. We used the transit light curve to characterize the planetary parameters relative to the stellar parameters. The analysis of HARPS spectra established the planetary nature of the detections, providing their masses. Further photometric and spectroscopic ground-based observations provided stellar parameters (log g,Teff,v sin i) to characterize the host stars. Our model takes the geometry of the transit to constrain the stellar density into account, which when linked to stellar evolutionary models, determines the bulk parameters of the star. Because of the asymmetric shape of the light curve of one of the planets, we had to include the possibility in our model that the stellar surface was not strictly spherical. Results. We present the planetary parameters of CoRoT-28b, a Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087MJup; radius 0.955+/-0.066RJup) orbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days, and CoRoT-29b, another Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20MJup; radius 0.90 +/- 0.16RJup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570 +/- 0.000 006 days. The reason behind the asymmetry of the transit shape is not understood at this point. Conclusions. These two new planetary systems have very interesting properties and deserve further study, particularly in the case of the star CoRoT-29.},

While normal magnetic diffusivity predicts lifetimes of sunspots that are too large by at least two orders of magnitude, turbulent magnetic diffusivity accounts for both the functional form of the solar empirical spot-lifetime relation and for the observed sunspot lifetimes, provided that the relevant diffusion length is the supergranule size. Applying this relation to other stars, the value of turbulent diffusivity depends almost entirely on supergranule size, with very weak dependence on other variables such as magnetic field strength and density. Overall, the best observational data for other stars is consistent with the extension of the solar relation, provided that stellar supergranule sizes for some stars are significantly larger than they are on the Sun.},

  abstract = {Context. Since 1998, a planet-search program around main sequence stars 
within 50 pc in the southern hemisphere has been carried out with the
CORALIE echelle spectrograph at La Silla Observatory. Aims: With
an observing time span of more than 14 years, the CORALIE survey is now
able to unveil Jovian planets on Jupiter's period domain. This growing
period-interval coverage is important for building formation and
migration models since observational constraints are still weak for
periods beyond the ice line. Methods: Long-term precise Doppler
measurements with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph, together with a few
additional observations made with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6
m telescope, reveal radial velocity signatures of massive planetary
companions on long-period orbits. Results: In this paper we
present seven new planets orbiting HD 27631, HD 98649, HD 106515A, HD
166724, HD 196067, HD 219077, and HD 220689, together with the CORALIE
orbital parameters for three already known planets around HD 10647, HD
30562, and HD 86226. The period range of the new planetary companions
goes from 2200 to 5500 days and covers a mass domain between 1 and 10.5
MJup. Surprisingly, five of them present very high
eccentricities above e $>$ 0.57. A pumping scenario by Kozai mechanism
may be invoked for HD 106515Ab and HD 196067b, which are both orbiting
stars in multiple systems. Since the presence of a third massive body
cannot be inferred from the data of HD 98649b, HD 166724b, and HD
219077b, the origin of the eccentricity of these systems remains
unknown. Except for HD 10647b, no constraint on the upper mass of the
planets is provided by Hipparcos astrometric data. Finally, the hosts of
these long period planets show no metallicity excess.

  abstract = {Context. Since low-mass stars have low luminosities, orbits at which liquid water can exist on Earth-sized planets are relatively close-
in, which produces Doppler signals that are detectable using state-of-the-art Doppler spectroscopy.
Aims. GJ 667C is already known to be orbited by two super-Earth candidates. We have recently applied developed data analysis
methods to investigate whether the data supports the presence of additional companions.
Methods. We obtain new Doppler measurements from HARPS extracted spectra and combined them with those obtained from the PFS
and HIRES spectrographs. We used Bayesian and periodogram-based methods to re-assess the number of candidates and evaluated
the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler
signal with measurements of several activity indices and investigated the possible quasi-periodic nature of signals.
Results. Doppler measurements of GJ 667C are described better by six (even seven) Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates
(b and c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62, and 39 days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day
orbit (g) and tantalizing evidence of a $\sim$1 M$\oplus$ object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We explore whether long-term stable orbits are
compatible with the data by integrating 8 \texttimes{} 104 solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. We assess their stability using secular
frequency analysis.
Conclusions. The system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable configurations. As for the solar system,
the most stable solutions do not contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic Laplace-Lagrange solutions.
Preliminary analysis also indicates that masses of the planets cannot be higher than twice the minimum masses obtained from Doppler
measurements. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of
stability left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects,
indicate that three (maybe four) planets are potentially habitable. Doppler and space-based transit surveys indicate that 1) dynamically
packed systems of super-Earths are relatively abundant and 2) M-dwarfs have more small planets than earlier-type stars. These two
trends together suggest that GJ 667C is one of the first members of an emerging population of M-stars with multiple low-mass planets
in their habitable zones.},

This is usually interpreted as evidence in support of the Core Accretion (CA) theory, which assembles giant planets as a result of formation of a massive solid core. A strong positive planet-metallicity correlation for giant planets formed in the framework of Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model is found here. The key novelty of this work is "pebble accretion" onto GI fragments which has been recently demonstrated to accelerate contraction of GI fragments. Driven closer to the star by the inward migration, only the fragments that accrete metals rapidly enough collapse and survive the otherwise imminent tidal disruption. The survival fraction of simulated planets correlates strongly with the metallicity of the host star, as observed.},

  abstract = {Aims: Stellar activity produced by spots and plages affects the 
radial velocity (RV) signatures. Because even low activity stars would
produce such a signal, it is crucial to determine how it influences our
ability to detect small planetary signals such as those produced by
Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone (HZ). In a recent paper, we
investigated the impact of sunlike spots. We aim here to investigate the
additional impact of plages. Methods: We used the spot and plage
properties over a solar cycle to derive the RV that would be observed if
the Sun was seen edge-on. The RV signal comes from the photometric
contribution of spots and plages and from the attenuation of the
convective blueshift in plages. We analyzed the properties of the RV
signal at different activity levels and compared it with commonly used
activity indicators such as photometry and the Ca index. We also
compared it with the signal that would be produced by an Earth-mass
planet in the HZ. Results: We find that the photometric
contributions of spots and plages to the RV signal partially balance
each other out, so that the residual signal is comparable to the spot
signal. However, the plage contribution due to the convective blueshift
attenuation dominates the total signal, with an amplitude over the solar
cycle of about 8-10 m/s. Short-term variations are also significantly
greater than the spot and plage photometric contribution. This
contribution is very strongly correlated with the Ca index on the long
term, which may be a way to distinguish between stellar activity and a
planet. Conclusions: Providing a very good temporal sampling and
signal-to-noise ratio, the photometric contribution of plages and spots
should not prevent detection of Earth-mass planets in the HZ. However,
the convection contribution makes such a direct detection impossible,
unless its effect can be corrected for by methods that still need to be
found. We show that it is possible to identify the convection
contribution if the sensitivity is good enough, for example, by using
activity indicators.},

  title = {The {{Transits}} of {{Extrasolar Planets}} with {{Moons}}},
  abstract = {The search for extrasolar planets is strongly motivated by the goal of characterizing how frequent habitable worlds and life may be within the Galaxy. Whilst much effort has been spent on searching for Earth-like planets, large moons may also be common, temperate abodes for life as well. The methods to detect extrasolar moons, or "exomoons" are more subtle than their planetary counterparts and in this thesis I aim to provide a method to find such bodies in transiting systems, which offer the greatest potential for detection. Before one can search for the tiny perturbations to the planetary signal, an understanding of the planetary transit must be established. Therefore, in Chapters 3 to 5 I discuss the transit model and provide several new insights. Chapter 4 presents new analytic expressions for the times of transit minima and the transit duration, which will be critical in the later search for exomoons. Chapter 5 discusses two sources of distortion to the transit signal, namely blending (with a focus on the previously unconsidered self-blending scenario) and light curve smearing due to long integration times. I provide methods to compensate for both of these effects, thus permitting for the accurate modelling of the planetary transit light curve. In Chapter 6, I discuss methods to detect exomoons through their gravitational influence on the host planet, giving rise to transit timing and duration variations (TTV and TDV). The previously known TTV effect is updated with a new model and the associated critical problems are outlined. I then predict a new effect, TDV, which solves these problems, making exomoon detection viable. Chapter 7 presents a feasibility study for detecting habitable-zone exomoons with Kepler, where it is found that moons down to 0.2 Earth masses are detectable. Finally, conclusions and future work are discussed in Chapter 8.},

This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature.

We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model. We show
surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these
equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric
representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced
flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training observations.

A statistic of the form U = $\sum$"$\Phi$(X$\alpha$ 1, $\cdots$, X$\alpha$m )/n(n - 1) $\cdots$ (n - m + 1), where the sum $\sum$" is extended over all permutations ($\alpha$1, $\cdots$, $\alpha$m) of m different integers, 1 $\leq$ $\alpha$i $\leq$ n, is called a U-statistic. If X1, $\cdots$, Xn have the same (cumulative) distribution function (d.f.) F(x), U is an unbiased estimate of the population characteristic \texttheta(F) = $\int$ $\cdots$ $\int\Phi$(x1, $\cdots$, xm) dF(x1) $\cdots$ dF(xm). \texttheta(F) is called a regular functional of the d.f. F(x). Certain optimal properties of U-statistics as unbiased estimates of regular functionals have been established by Halmos [9] (cf. Section 4). The variance of a U-statistic as a function of the sample size n and of certain population characteristics is studied in Section 5. It is shown that if X1, $\cdots$, Xn have the same distribution and $\Phi$(x1, $\cdots$, xm) is independent of n, the d.f. of \$$\backslash$sqrt n(U - $\backslash$theta)\$ tends to a normal d.f. as n $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ under the sole condition of the existence of E$\Phi$2(X1, $\cdots$, Xm). Similar results hold for the joint distribution of several U-statistics (Theorems 7.1 and 7.2), for statistics U' which, in a certain sense, are asymptotically equivalent to U (Theorems 7.3 and 7.4), for certain functions of statistics U or U' (Theorem 7.5) and, under certain additional assumptions, for the case of the X$\nu$'s having different distributions (Theorems 8.1 and 8.2). Results of a similar character, though under different assumptions, are contained in a recent paper by von Mises [18] (cf. Section 7). Examples of statistics of the form U or U' are the moments, Fisher's k-statistics, Gini's mean difference, and several rank correlation statistics such as Spearman's rank correlation and the difference sign correlation (cf. Section 9). Asymptotic power functions for the non-parametric tests of independence based on these rank statistics are obtained. They show that these tests are not unbiased in the limit (Section 9f). The asymptotic distribution of the coefficient of partial difference sign correlation which has been suggested by Kendall also is obtained (Section 9h).},

  title = {The {{Log Log Prior}} for the {{Frequency}} of {{Extraterrestrial Intelligences}}},
  abstract = {It is unclear how frequently life and intelligence arise on planets. I consider a Bayesian prior for the probability P(ETI) that intelligence evolves at a suitable site, with weight distributed evenly over ln(1 - ln P(ETI)). This log log prior can handle a very wide range of P(ETI) values, from 1 to 10\^(-10\^122), while remaining responsive to evidence about extraterrestrial societies. It is motivated by our uncertainty in the number of conditions that must be fulfilled for intelligence to arise, and it is related to considerations of information, entropy, and state space dimensionality. After setting a lower limit to P(ETI) from the number of possible genome sequences, I calculate a Bayesian confidence of 18\% that aliens exist within the observable Universe. With different assumptions about the minimum P(ETI) and the number of times intelligence can appear on a planet, this value falls between 1.4\% and 47\%. Overall, the prior leans towards our being isolated from extraterrestrial intelligences, but indicates that we should not be confident of this conclusion. I discuss the implications of the prior for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, concluding that searches for interstellar probes from nearby societies seem relatively effective. I also discuss the possibility of very small probabilities allowed by the prior for the origin of life and the Fermi Paradox, and note that similar priors might be constructed for interesting complex phenomena in general.},

Jupiter (2.1 MJup) and with an orbital period of 44.24 days.
The outer planet is even more massive (6.6 MJup) with a
slightly eccentric orbit (e = 0.13) and a period of 1008 days. The
planet orbiting HD 171238 has a minimum mass of 2.6
MJup, a period of 1523 days and an eccentricity of 0.40. It
orbits a G8 dwarfs at 2.5 AU. The last planet, HD
204313 b, is a 4.0 MJup-planet with a period of 5.3
years and has a low eccentricity (e = 0.13). It orbits a G5 dwarfs at
3.1 AU. The three parent stars are metal rich, which further strengthens
the case that massive planets tend to form around metal rich stars.

  abstract = {We present an in-depth analysis of stellar activity and its effects on radial velocity (RV) for the M2 dwarf GJ 176 based on spectra taken over 10 years from the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. These data are supplemented with spectra from previous observations with the HIRES and HARPS spectrographs, and V- and R-band photometry taken over 6 years at the Dyer and Fairborn observatories. Previous studies of GJ 176 revealed a super-Earth exoplanet in an 8.8-day orbit. However, the velocities of this star are also known to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39-day stellar rotation period. We have examined the magnetic activity of GJ 176 using the sodium I D lines, which have been shown to be a sensitive activity tracer in cool stars. In addition to rotational modulation, we see evidence of a long-term trend in our Na I D index, which may be part of a long-period activity cycle. The sodium index is well correlated with our RVs, and we show that this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in RV. Interestingly, the rotation signal remains in phase in photometry, but not in the spectral activity indicators. We interpret this phenomenon as the result of one or more large spot complexes or active regions which dominate the photometric variability, while the spectral indices are driven by the overall magnetic activity across the stellar surface. In light of these results, we discuss the potential for correcting activity signals in the RVs of M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {We consider the impact of Doppler noise models on the statistical 
robustness of the exoplanetary radial velocity fits. We show that the
traditional model of the Doppler noise with an additive jitter can
generate large non-linearity effects, decreasing the reliability of the
fit, especially in the cases when a correlated Doppler noise is
involved. We introduce a regularization of the additive noise model that
can gracefully eliminate its singularities together with the associated
non-linearity effects. We apply this approach to Doppler time series
data of several exoplanetary systems. It demonstrates that our new
regularized noise model yields orbital fits that have either increased
or at least the same statistical robustness, in comparison with the
simple additive jitter. Various statistical uncertainties in the
parametric estimations are often reduced, while planet detection
significance is often increased. Concerning the 55 Cnc five-planet
system, we show that its Doppler data contain significant correlated
(`red') noise. Its correlation time-scale is in the range from days to
months, and its magnitude is much larger than the effect of the
planetary N-body perturbations in the radial velocity (these
perturbations thus appear undetectable). Characteristics of the red
noise depend on the spectrograph/observatory, and also show a cyclic
time variation in phase with the public Ca II H\&K and photometry
measurements. We interpret this modulation as a hint of the long-term
activity cycle of 55 Cnc, similar to the solar 11-yr cycle. We estimate
the 55 Cnc activity period by 12.6$\pm$ \^\{2.5\}\_\{1.0\} yr, with the
nearest minimum presumably expected in 2014 or 2015.},

Kepler is the tenth in the series of NASA Discovery Program missions that are competitively-selected, PI-directed, medium-cost missions. The Mission concept and various instrument prototypes were developed at the Ames Research Center over a period of 18 years starting in 1983. The development of techniques to do the 10 ppm photometry required for Mission success took years of experimentation, several workshops, and the exploration of many `blind alleys' before the construction of the flight instrument. Beginning in 1992 at the start of the NASA Discovery Program, the Kepler Mission concept was proposed five times before its acceptance for mission development in 2001. During that period, the concept evolved from a photometer in an L2 orbit that monitored 6000 stars in a 50 sq deg field-of-view (FOV) to one that was in a heliocentric orbit that simultaneously monitored 170 000 stars with a 105 sq deg FOV. Analysis of the data to date has detected over 4600 planetary candidates which include several hundred Earth-size planetary candidates, over a thousand confirmed planets, and Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (HZ). These discoveries provide the information required for estimates of the frequency of planets in our galaxy. The Mission results show that most stars have planets, many of these planets are similar in size to the Earth, and that systems with several planets are common. Although planets in the HZ are common, many are substantially larger than Earth.},

days in metal-poor stars and (2) a paucity of sub-Jovian planets (4 R $\oplus$ $<$ R $<$ 8 R $\oplus$) with P $<$ 100

  abstract = {We analyzed the host stars of the present sample of confirmed planets detected by Kepler and Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) to compute new photometric rotation periods and to study the behavior of their angular momentum. Lomb-Scargle periodograms and wavelet maps were computed for 3,807 stars. For 540 of these stars, we were able to detect rotational modulation of the light curves at a significance level of greater than 99\%. For 63 of these 540 stars, no rotation measurements were previously available in the literature. According to the published masses and evolutionary tracks of the stars in this sample, the sample is composed of M- to F-type stars (with masses of 0.48-1.53 M\$\_\{$\backslash$odot\}\$) with rotation periods that span a range of 2 to 89 days. These periods exhibit an excellent agreement with previously reported (for the stars for which such values are available), and the observed rotational period distribution strongly agrees with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, for the 540 sources considered here, the stellar angular momentum provides an important test of Kraft's relation based on the photometric rotation periods. Finally, this study directly contributes in a direct approach to our understanding of how angular momentum is distributed between the host star and its (detected) planetary system; the role of angular momentum exchange in such systems is an unavoidable piece of the stellar rotation puzzle.},

A common statistical example is finite mixture modelling. In the Bayesian framework, these problems are typically solved using one of the following two methods: i) by executing a Monte Carlo algorithm (such as Nested Sampling) once for each possible value of \$N\$, and calculating the marginal likelihood or evidence as a function of \$N\$; or ii) by doing a single run that allows the model dimension \$N\$ to change (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with birth/death moves), and obtaining the posterior for \$N\$ directly. In this paper we present a general approach to this problem that uses trans-dimensional MCMC embedded within a Nested Sampling algorithm, allowing us to explore the posterior distribution and calculate the marginal likelihood (summed over \$N\$) even if the problem contains a phase transition or other difficult features such as multimodality. We present two example problems, finding sinusoidal signals in noisy data, and finding and measuring galaxies in a noisy astronomical image. Both of the examples demonstrate phase transitions in the relationship between the likelihood and the cumulative prior mass, highlighting the need for Nested Sampling.},

  abstract = {Radial velocity data sets hold information about the direct observability (e.g., separation and flux) of inferred companions. They also contain information about the types of Keplerian solution compatible with the data. "Monte Carlo projection" and "$\chi$ 2 portrayal" are two techniques for discovering and pursuing the implications of this information. The first (projection) involves random solutions consistent with the data set, from which we can estimate (1) the probability distribution of the true solution in the six-dimensional space of the Keplerian parameters and (2) the probability distribution of the companion's position in space at future times, in order to predict observability. The second technique (portrayal) involves the distribution in parameter space of values of the numerical $\chi$ 2 function, from which we can estimate the regions that contain the true solution at various levels of confidence. We study the case of HD 72659, a Sun-like star at 51 pc with a radial velocity companion inferred from 16 data points. We find at least two types of Keplerian solutions present in the data set: (1) periods 2500-25,000 days and eccentricity 0-0.8 (type A1), (2) periods 25,000-250,000 days and eccentricity 0.8-0.95 (type A2), and (3) periods 2000-2500 days and eccentricity 0-0.5 (type B). (Types A1 and A2 may not be distinct.) Pursuing direct observability, we randomize the inclination angle and compute the apparent separation, true separation, and phase angle of the companion. We compute a minimum flux ratio to the star assuming no self-luminosity and that the companion is Jupiter sized and has Jupiter's albedo and the phase function of a Lambert sphere. We plot the probability distribution of direct observability at specific epochs.},

  abstract = {There is a unique solution of the planet and star parameters from a planet transit light curve with two or more transits if the planet has a circular orbit and the light curve is observed in a bandpass where limb darkening is negligible. The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of R p . Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can then be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling for a two-transit light curve).},

Many known exoplanets (planets outside our own solar system) are hosted by binary systems that contain two stars. These planets normally circle around both of their stars. Using microlensing data taken with a worldwide network of telescopes, Gould et al. found a planet twice the mass of Earth that circles just one of a pair of stars. The same approach has the potential to uncover other similar star systems and help to illuminate some of the mysteries of planet formation.
Science, this issue p. 46
Using gravitational microlensing, we detected a cold terrestrial planet orbiting one member of a binary star system. The planet has low mass (twice Earth's) and lies projected at \textasciitilde{}0.8 astronomical units (AU) from its host star, about the distance between Earth and the Sun. However, the planet's temperature is much lower, $<$60 Kelvin, because the host star is only 0.10 to 0.15 solar masses and therefore more than 400 times less luminous than the Sun. The host itself orbits a slightly more massive companion with projected separation of 10 to 15 AU. This detection is consistent with such systems being very common. Straightforward modification of current microlensing search strategies could increase sensitivity to planets in binary systems. With more detections, such binary-star planetary systems could constrain models of planet formation and evolution.

  title = {Chaotic {{Interactions}} in {{Multiple Planet Systems}}},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {The detection of \textasciitilde{}100 extrasolar planets has provided many challenges for theories of planet formation. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the surprising distributions of semi-major axes and eccentricities. Dynamical instabilities and chaotic interactions in planetary systems with multiple giant planets appear to provide a natural mechanism for producing the highly eccentric orbits frequently observed. In a protoplanetary disk, the semi-major axis of a protoplanet is determined before the mass of the eventual planet. As nearby
protoplanets accrete mass, a dynamical instability may lead to close encounters. Alternatively, a dissipative disk may prevent mutual interactions from exciting significant eccentricities. Once the disk clears, the eccentricities may grow and eventually permit close
encounters. In any case, once planets begin to undergo close encounters, the planets may collide or be ejected from the system. These processes can significantly alter the orbits of the remaining planets. Numerical orbital integrations of possible planetary systems can determine the frequencies of the final outcomes for such systems and allow for comparison with observations. Simulations for two equal-mass planets initially on nearly circular coplanar orbits result in a bimodal distribution for the final eccentricity. Initial conditions leading to a collisions between the two planets produce a more massive planet in a nearly circular orbit. Instead when one planet is ejected from the system, the other planet remains on an eccentric orbit with 0.4 $\leq$ e $\leq$ 0.8. However, if the two planets have different masses, then the eccentricity after an ejection depends on the ratio of the planet masses. The observed distribution of eccentricities can be well
reproduced for plausible distributions of the planet mass ratio. While a proper comparison would require careful consideration of observational selection effects and the unknown initial distributions, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of \_ 0.8 independent of these complications. Simulations for three equal-mass planets initially on nearly circular coplanar orbits also result in a broad distribution of final eccentricities which seldom exceeds 0.8. The three-planet scattering model distinguishes itself by predicting that an additional planet typically lies on a longer period orbit. Further, the relative inclination between the two planets is typically increased, up to \textasciitilde{}40$^\circ$. Future observations, including long-term radial
velocity measurements , long-term precision astrometric measurements, and direct imaging, could test these predictions.},

  shorttitle = {Kepler-447b},
  abstract = {We present the radial velocity confirmation of the extrasolar planet Kepler-447b, initially detected as a candidate by the Kepler mission. In this work, we analyze its transit signal and the radial velocity data obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph (CAFE). By simultaneously modeling both datasets, we obtain the orbital and physical properties of the system. According to our results, Kepler-447b is a Jupiter-mass planet (\$M\_p=1.37\^\{+0.48\}\_\{-0.46\}\textasciitilde{}M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$), with an estimated radius of \$R\_p=1.65\^\{+0.59\}\_\{-0.56\}\textasciitilde{}R\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ (uncertainties provided in this work are \$3$\backslash$sigma\$ unless specified). This translates into a sub-Jupiter density. The planet revolves every \$$\backslash$sim7.8\$ days in a slightly eccentric orbit (\$e=0.123\^\{+0.037\}\_\{-0.036\}\$) around a G8V star with detected activity in the Kepler light curve. Kepler-447b transits its host with a large impact parameter (\$b=1.076\^\{+0.112\}\_\{-0.086\}\$), being one of the few planetary grazing transits confirmed so far and the first in the Kepler large crop of exoplanets. We estimate that only around 20\% of the projected planet disk occults the stellar disk. The relatively large uncertainties in the planet radius are due to the large impact parameter and short duration of the transit. Planets with such an extremely large impact parameter can be used to detect and analyze interesting configurations such as additional perturbing bodies, stellar pulsations, rotation of a non-spherical planet, or polar spot-crossing events. All these scenarios would periodically modify the transit properties (depth, duration, and time of mid-transit), what could be detectable with sufficient accurate photometry. Short-cadence photometric data (at the 1 minute level) would help in the search for these exotic configurations in grazing planetary transits like that of Kepler-447b.},

  abstract = {There is no universally acknowledged criterion to distinguish brown dwarfs from planets. Numerous studies have used or suggested a definition based on an object's mass, taking the 13 Jupiter mass ( M J ) limit for the ignition of deuterium. Here, we investigate various deuterium-burning masses for a range of models. We find that, while 13 M J is generally a reasonable rule of thumb, the deuterium fusion mass depends on the helium abundance, the initial deuterium abundance, the metallicity of the model, and on what fraction of an object's initial deuterium abundance must combust in order for the object to qualify as having burned deuterium. Even though, for most proto-brown dwarf conditions, 50\% of the initial deuterium will burn if the object's mass is (13.0 $\pm$ 0.8) M J , the full range of possibilities is significantly broader. For models ranging from zero-metallicity to more than three times solar metallicity, the deuterium-burning mass ranges from 11.0 M J (for three times solar metallicity, 10\% of initial deuterium burned) to 16.3 M J ( for zero metallicity, 90\% of initial deuterium burned).},

marginalization integrals for a single planet including the possibility of a long-term trend. The result is a robust algorithm that is rapid enough for use in real-time analysis that outputs constraints on orbital parameters and false-alarm probabilities for the planet and long-term trend. The constraints on parameters and odds ratio that we derive compare well with previous calculations based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and we compare our results with other techniques for estimating false-alarm probabilities and errors in derived orbital parameters. False-alarm probabilities from the Bayesian analysis are systematically higher than frequentist false-alarm probabilities, due to the different accounting of the number of trials. We show that upper limits on the velocity amplitude derived for circular orbits are a good estimate of the upper limit on the amplitude of eccentric orbits for e $<$\textasciitilde{} 0.5.},

  doi = {10.1086/308815},
  abstract = {We derive octupole-level secular perturbation equations for hierarchical triple systems, using classical Hamiltonian perturbation techniques. Our equations describe the secular evolution of the orbital eccentricities and inclinations over timescales that are long compared to the orbital periods. By extending previous work done to leading (quadrupole) order to octupole level (i.e., including terms of order $\alpha$ 3 , where $\alpha$ $\equiv$ a 1 / a 2 $<$ 1 is the ratio of semimajor axes), we obtain expressions that are applicable to a much wider range of parameters. In particular, our results can be applied to high-inclination as well as coplanar systems, and our expressions are valid for almost all mass ratios for which the system is in a stable hierarchical configuration. In contrast, the standard quadrupole-level theory of Kozai gives a vanishing result in the limit of zero relative inclination. The classical planetary perturbation theory, while valid to all orders in $\alpha$, applies only to orbits of low-mass objects orbiting a common central mass, with low eccentricities and low relative inclinations. For triple systems containing a close inner binary, we also discuss the possible interaction between the classical Newtonian perturbations and the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit. In some cases we show that this interaction can lead to resonances and a significant increase in the maximum amplitude of eccentricity perturbations. We establish the validity of our analytic expressions by providing detailed comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of the three-body problem obtained for a large number of representative cases. In addition, we show that our expressions reduce correctly to previously published analytic results obtained in various limiting regimes. We also discuss applications of the theory in the context of several observed triple systems of current interest, including the millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 in M4, the giant planet in 16 Cygni, and the protostellar binary TMR-1.},

This situation is especially acute with the Kepler survey, which has found over 2300 candidates but has to date confirmed only a small fraction of them as planets. I present here a general procedure that can quickly be applied to any planet candidate to calculate its false positive probability. This procedure takes into account the period, depth, duration, and shape of the signal; the colors of the target star; arbitrary spectroscopic or imaging follow-up observations; and informed assumptions about the populations and distributions of field stars and multiple-star properties. Applying these methods to a sample of known Kepler planets, I demonstrate that many signals can be validated with very limited follow-up observations: in most cases with only a spectrum and an adaptive optics image. Additionally, I demonstrate that this procedure can reliably identify false positive signals. Because of the computational efficiency of this analysis, it is feasible to apply it to all Kepler planet candidates in the near future, and it will streamline the follow-up efforts for Kepler and other current and future transit surveys.},

Assuming the signal is periodic, we illustrate that systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies, by only using data from inside a time window which is matched to the main planet transits. This results in a reconstruction of the signal which on average is unbiased, despite that no prior knowledge of either the noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis. The method has therefore clear advantages over standard phase folding, which normally requires external input such as nearby stars or noise models for removing systematic components. In addition, we extract the full 360 degree transit signal simultaneously, and Kepler like data can be analyzed in just a few seconds. We illustrate the performance of our method by applying it to a dataset composed of light curves from Kepler with a fake injected signal emulating a planet with rings. For extracting periodic transit signals, our presented method is in general the optimal and least biased estimator and could therefore lead the way towards the first detections of, e.g., planet rings and exo-trojan asteroids.},

parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo
characteristics.},

Follow-up observations by both the Lick and Advanced Fiber-Optic Echelle spectrometer (AFOE) planet survey programs confirm this periodicity and reveal additional periodicities at 241 and 1267 days. These periodicities are consistent with Keplerian orbital motion and imply two additional companions orbiting at 0.83 and 2.5 AU, with minimum ( M sin i ) masses of 2.0 and 4.6 M JUP , respectively. Non-Keplerian explanations for the observed Doppler velocity variations, including radial and nonradial pulsations, rotational modulation of surface features, and stellar magnetic cycles, are examined. These explanations seem unlikely based on the observed photometric and chromospheric stability of the star. This putative three-planet system is found to be dynamically stable by both analytic techniques and numerical simulations. The outer two companions both reside in eccentric orbits, as do all nine known extrasolar planet candidates in distant orbits. If real, this multiple-planet system is the first around a main-sequence star, and its study should offer insights into planet formation, planet-planet interactions, and the observed eccentricities of planetary orbits.},

Of the hundreds of Kepler planets now discovered, the seven-planet system Kepler-90 is unusual for exhibiting an unidentified transit-like signal in close proximity to one of the transits of the long-period gas-giant Kepler-90g, as noted by Cabrera et. al. (2014). As part of the 'Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler' (HEK) project, we investigate this possible exomoon signal and find it passes all conventional photometric, dynamical and centroid diagnostic tests. However, pixel-level light curves indicate that the moon-like signal occurs on nearly all of the target's pixels, which we confirm using a novel way of examining pixel-level data which we dub the 'transit centroid'. This test reveals that the possible exomoon to Kepler-90g is likely a false positive, perhaps due to a cosmic ray induced Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropout (SPSD). This work highlights the extreme care required for seeking non-periodic low-amplitude transit signals, such as exomoons.},

  abstract = {The giant planet orbiting $\tau$ Bootis (named $\tau$ Bootis b) was amongst the first extrasolar planets to be discovered. It is one of the brightest exoplanets and one of the nearest to us, with an orbital period of just a few days. Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced and refuted, and have hitherto remained elusive. Here we report the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum of $\tau$ Bootis b. At a spectral resolution of [sim]100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of 44.5$^\circ$\,$\pm$\,1.5$^\circ$ and a mass 5.95\,$\pm$\,0.28 times that of Jupiter, demonstrating that atmospheric characterization is possible for non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes, in contrast to the temperature inversion inferred for other highly irradiated planets. This supports the hypothesis that the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed in $\tau$ Bootis b by the ultraviolet emission from the active host star.},

  abstract = {Sun-like stars have stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary companions. To help constrain their formation and migration scenarios, we analyze the close companions (orbital period $<$5 yr) of nearby Sun-like stars. By using the same sample to extract the relative numbers of stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary companions, we verify the existence of a very dry brown dwarf desert and describe it quantitatively. With decreasing mass, the companion mass function drops by almost 2 orders of magnitude from1 M $\Sun$ stellar companions to the brown dwarf desert and then rises by more than an order of magnitude from brown dwarfs to Jupiter-mass planets. The slopes of the planetary and stellar companion mass functions are of opposite sign and are incompatible at the 3 $\sigma$ level, thus yielding a brown dwarf desert. The minimum number of companions per unit interval in log mass (the driest part of the desert) is at M = 31 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/640/2/1051/img1.gif] img1.gif M J . Approximately 16\% of Sun-like stars have close ( P $<$ 5 yr) companions more massive than Jupiter: 11\% $\pm$ 3\% are stellar, $<$1\% are brown dwarf, and 5\% $\pm$ 2\% are giant planets. The steep decline in the number of companions in the brown dwarf regime, compared to the initial mass function of individual stars and free-floating brown dwarfs, suggests either a different spectrum of gravitational fragmentation in the formation environment or post-formation migratory processes disinclined to leave brown dwarfs in close orbits.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an extension of the linear least-squares (or 
Lomb-Scargle) periodogram for the case when the model of the signal to
be detected is non-sinusoidal and depends on unknown parameters in a
non-linear manner. The problem of estimating the statistical
significance of candidate periodicities found using such non-linear
periodograms is examined. This problem is related to the task of
quantifying the distributions of the maximum values of these
periodograms. Based on recent results in the mathematical theory of
extreme values of a random field (the generalized Rice method), a
general approach is provided to find a useful analytic approximation for
these distributions. This approximation has the general form e\^\{-z\}
P(\&surd;\{z\}), where P is an algebraic polynomial and z is the
periodogram maximum.

The general tools developed in this paper can be used in a wide variety
of astronomical applications, for instance in the study of variable
stars and extra-solar planets. With this in mind, we develop and
consider in detail the so-called von Mises periodogram - a specialized
non-linear periodogram in which the signal is modelled by the von Mises
periodic function exp (nu cos omegat). This simple function with an
additional non-linear parameter nu can model the light curves of many
astronomical objects that show various types of periodic photometric
variability. We prove that our approach can be perfectly applied to this
non-linear periodogram.

We provide a package of auxiliary C++ programs, attached as online-only
material. These programs should facilitate the use of the von Mises
periodogram in practice.},

  abstract = {Future generations of precise radial velocity (RV) surveys aim to achieve sensitivity sufficient to detect Earth mass planets orbiting in their stars' habitable zones. A major obstacle to this goal is astrophysical radial velocity noise caused by active areas moving across the stellar limb as a star rotates. In this paper, we quantify how stellar activity impacts exoplanet detection with radial velocities as a function of orbital and stellar rotational periods. We perform data-driven simulations of how stellar rotation affects planet detectability and compile and present relations for the typical timescale and amplitude of stellar radial velocity noise as a function of stellar mass. We show that the characteristic timescales of quasi-periodic radial velocity jitter from stellar rotational modulations coincides with the orbital period of habitable zone exoplanets around early M-dwarfs. These coincident periods underscore the importance of monitoring the targets of RV habitable zone planet surveys through simultaneous photometric measurements for determining rotation periods and activity signals, and mitigating activity signals using spectroscopic indicators and/or RV measurements at different wavelengths.},

A recent paper announced the possible discovery of two additional super-Earth planets in that system, one of which would be in the middle of the habitable zone of Gl 581. The statistical significance of those two discoveries has, however, been questioned. We have obtained 121 new radial velocity measurements of Gl 581 with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6 m telescope, and analyse those together with our previous 119 measurements of that star to examine these potential additional planets. We find that neither is likely to exist with their proposed parameters. We also obtained photometric observations with the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope during a potential transit of the inner planet, Gl 581e, which had a 5\% geometric transit probability. Those observations exclude transits for planet densities under 4 times the Earth density within -0.2 sigma to +2.7 sigma of the predicted transit center.},

The planet mass and orbital distance are similar to predictions for the critical core mass needed to accrete a substantial gaseous envelope, and thus may indicate that this planet is a "failed" gas giant.

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii \$$<$4 R\_$\backslash$oplus\$, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern for these studies is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates for this Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. We analyze how the details depend on the radius range of the sample, and on the method used to provide the mass measurements. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that \$M/M\_$\backslash$oplus=2.7(R/R\_$\backslash$oplus)\^\{1.3\}\$ and a scatter in mass of \$1.9M\_$\backslash$oplus\$ is the "best-fit" probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (\$R\_\{pl\}$<$4 R\_$\backslash$oplus\$).},

It has been proposed that USP planets are the solid cores of hot Jupiters that lost their gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We test this hypothesis by asking whether USP planets are associated with metal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. In contrast, we find the metallicity distributions of USP and hot-Jupiter hosts to be significantly different (\$p = 2$\backslash$times 10\^\{-4\}\$), based on Keck spectroscopy of Kepler stars. Evidently the sample of USP planets is not dominated by the evaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of USP hosts is indistinguishable from that of short-period planets with sizes between 2-4 \$R\_$\backslash$oplus\$. Thus it remains possible that the USP planets are the solid cores of formerly gaseous sub-Neptune planets.},

Magnetic-flux concentrations of 600-1000 G are found to be located in areas of suppressed downflow near holes or pores in the granulation pattern, while 100-500-G concentrations occur in areas with stronger downdrafts, in cell-like structures of diameter 2-5 arcsec, the fields being aligned with dark intergranular lanes. It is inferred that granulation concentrates the magnetic field in the downflow lanes (as found in numerical simulations by Nordlund, 1983), and that the magnetic structures are more diffuse and longer-lasting than the bright spots; thus bright-point maps are contained in, rather than equivalent to, magnetic-field maps.},

  abstract = {Doppler spectroscopy has detected 152 planets around nearby stars. A major puzzle is why many of their orbits are highly eccentric; all planets in our Solar System are on nearly circular orbits, as is expected if they formed by accretion processes in a protostellar disk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been little observational evidence to support any particular model. Here we report that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around upsilon Andromedae ($\upsilon$ And) probably results from a close dynamical interaction with another planet, now lost from the system. The planets started on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet ($\upsilon$ And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the eccentricity of the middle planet ($\upsilon$ And c). Indeed, we show that $\upsilon$ And c periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 6,700 years.},

  abstract = {We report on the detection of a planetary companion in orbit around the primary star of the binary system $\gamma$ Cephei. High-precision radial velocity measurements using four independent data sets spanning the time interval 1981-2002 reveal long-lived residual radial velocity variations superposed on the binary orbit that are coherent in phase and amplitude with a period or 2.48 yr (906 days) and a semiamplitude of 27.5 m s -1 . We performed a careful analysis of our Ca II H and K S -index measurements, spectral line bisectors, and Hipparcos photometry. We found no significant variations in these quantities with the 906 day period. We also reanalyzed the Ca II $\lambda$8662 measurements of Walker et al., which showed possible periodic variations with the "planet" period when first published. This analysis shows that periodic Ca II equivalent width variations were only present during 1986.5-1992 and absent during 1981-1986.5. Furthermore, a refined period for the Ca II $\lambda$8662 variations is 2.14 yr, significantly less than the residual radial velocity period. The most likely explanation of the residual radial velocity variations is a planetary-mass companion with M sin i = 1.7 M J and an orbital semimajor axis of a 2 = 2.13 AU. This supports the planet hypothesis for the residual radial velocity variations for $\gamma$ Cep first suggested by Walker et al. With an estimated binary orbital period of 57 yr, $\gamma$ Cep is the shortest period binary system in which an extrasolar planet has been found. This system may provide insights into the relationship between planetary and binary star formation.},

  title = {Limits on {{Planetary Companions}} from {{Doppler Surveys}} of {{Nearby Stars}}},
  abstract = {Most of our knowledge of planets orbiting nearby stars comes from Doppler surveys. For spaced-based, high-contrast imaging missions, nearby stars with Doppler-discovered planets are attractive targets. The known orbits tell imaging missions where and when to observe, and the dynamically-determined masses provide important constraints for the interpretation of planetary spectra. Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been detected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization. We analyzed Doppler measurements from Lick and Keck Observatories collected by the California Planet Survey. We focused on stars that are likely targets for three space-based planet imaging mission concepts studied by NASA--WFIRST-AFTA, Exo-C, and Exo-S. The Doppler targets are primarily F8 and later main sequence stars, with observations spanning 1987-2014. We identified 76 stars with Doppler measurements from the prospective mission target lists. We developed an automated planet search and a methodology to estimate the pipeline completeness using injection and recovery tests. We applied this machinery to the Doppler data and computed planet detection limits for each star as a function of planet minimum mass and semi-major axis. For typical stars in the survey, we are sensitive to approximately Saturn-mass planets inside of 1 AU, Jupiter-mass planets inside of \textasciitilde{}3 AU, and our sensitivity declines out to \textasciitilde{}10 AU. For the best Doppler targets, we are sensitive to Neptune-mass planets in 3 AU orbits. Using an idealized model of Doppler survey completeness, we forecast the precision of future surveys of non-ideal Doppler targets that are likely targets of imaging missions.},

The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.},

combination of precise radial-velocity measurements from three
telescopes reveals the presence of a planet with a period of 35.68 $\pm$ 0.03 days and minimum mass (m sin i) of 5.4 $\pm$ 1.0 Earth
masses. GJ 832c moves on a low-eccentricity orbit (e = 0.18 $\pm$
0.13) toward the inner edge of the habitable zone. However, given the large mass of the planet, it seems likely that it would possess a massive atmosphere, which may well render the planet inhospitable. Indeed, it is perhaps more likely that GJ 832c is a "super-Venus," featuring significant greenhouse forcing. With an outer giant planet and an interior, potentially rocky planet, the GJ 832 planetary system can be thought of as a miniature version of our own solar system.

distribution of covariates is modeled by a flexible mixture of Gaussians rather than assumed to be uniform. Here I extend the K07 algorithm in two ways. First, the procedure is generalized to the case of multiple response variables. Second, I describe how to model the prior
distribution of covariates using a Dirichlet process, which can be thought of as a Gaussian mixture where the number of mixture components is learned from the data. I present an example of multivariate
regression using the extended algorithm, namely fitting scaling
relations of the gas mass, temperature, and luminosity of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters as a function of their mass and redshift. An implementation of the Gibbs sampler in the R language, called LRGS, is provided.},

For most, the data can be sufficiently explained by non-interacting Keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of these systems have not been observed. Here we present four sets of light curves from the Kepler spacecraft, each which of shows multiple planets transiting the same star. Departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates that the planets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match the forcing frequency of the other planet. This confirms that these objects are in the same system. Next we limit their masses to the planetary regime by requiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. Finally, we report dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for the planets' masses and eccentricities. As the timespan of timing data increases, dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures, even in cases for which high-precision Doppler follow-up is impractical.},

Matching the stellar to the solar third signature also results in a determination of the apparent absolute radial velocity of the star with errors ranging from 80 to 300 m s \textendash{}1 , but potentially considerably smaller.

The orbital periods are nearly in the ratio of 2 : 1, unprecedented among major planets but common among moons and asteroids. Moreover, the axes of the elliptical orbits appear to be nearly aligned. The inner companion was not recognized previously owing to the 2 : 1 ratio of periods, which allowed its signature to masquerade as added orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Dynamical simulations show that the system is stable within a subset of the observed orbital parameters. The stability may be provided by a mean-motion resonance and the apparent alignment of the major axes. These planets pose unsolved questions about their formation and dynamical evolution, which brought them within 0.08 AU of each other and locked them in resonance.},
